This is the simple start of a standard OneBody Plugin architecture.

Each directory in the /plugins directory can add routes, models,
views, and controllers to your OneBody installation.

Each plugin in this directory is disabled by default. To enable:

# ruby plugins/checkin/install.rb

Disable by running:

# ruby plugins/checkin/uninstall.rb
