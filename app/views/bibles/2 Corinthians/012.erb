  <h2>2 Corinthians 12</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:1" id="2_Corinthians-12-1">It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:2" id="2_Corinthians-12-2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don&#8217;t know, or whether out of the body, I don&#8217;t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:3" id="2_Corinthians-12-3">I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don&#8217;t know; God knows),</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:4" id="2_Corinthians-12-4">how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:5" id="2_Corinthians-12-5">On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:6" id="2_Corinthians-12-6">For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:7" id="2_Corinthians-12-7">By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:8" id="2_Corinthians-12-8">Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:9" id="2_Corinthians-12-9">He has said to me, &#8220;My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.&#8221; Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:10" id="2_Corinthians-12-10">Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ&#8217;s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:11" id="2_Corinthians-12-11">I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:12" id="2_Corinthians-12-12">Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:13" id="2_Corinthians-12-13">For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:14" id="2_Corinthians-12-14">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:15" id="2_Corinthians-12-15">I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:16" id="2_Corinthians-12-16">But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:17" id="2_Corinthians-12-17">Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:18" id="2_Corinthians-12-18">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn&#8217;t we walk in the same spirit? Didn&#8217;t we walk in the same steps?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:19" id="2_Corinthians-12-19">Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:20" id="2_Corinthians-12-20">For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don&#8217;t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Corinthians 12:21" id="2_Corinthians-12-21">that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</span>
