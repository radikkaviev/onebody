  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:2" id="Psalm-78-2">I will open my mouth in a parable.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will utter dark sayings of old,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:3" id="Psalm-78-3">Which we have heard and known,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and our fathers have told us.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:4" id="Psalm-78-4">We will not hide them from their children,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>his strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:5" id="Psalm-78-5">For he established a testimony in Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and appointed a teaching in Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>which he commanded our fathers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that they should make them known to their children;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:6" id="Psalm-78-6">that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who should arise and tell their children,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:7" id="Psalm-78-7">that they might set their hope in God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and not forget the works of God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but keep his commandments,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:8" id="Psalm-78-8">and might not be as their fathers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a generation that didn&#8217;t make their hearts loyal,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>whose spirit was not steadfast with God.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:9" id="Psalm-78-9">The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>turned back in the day of battle.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:10" id="Psalm-78-10">They didn&#8217;t keep God&#8217;s covenant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and refused to walk in his law.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:11" id="Psalm-78-11">They forgot his doings,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>his wondrous works that he had shown them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:12" id="Psalm-78-12">He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:14" id="Psalm-78-14">In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and all night with a light of fire.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:15" id="Psalm-78-15">He split rocks in the wilderness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:16" id="Psalm-78-16">He brought streams also out of the rock,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:17" id="Psalm-78-17">Yet they still went on to sin against him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:18" id="Psalm-78-18">They tempted God in their heart<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>by asking food according to their desire.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:19" id="Psalm-78-19">Yes, they spoke against God.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They said, &#8220;Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:20" id="Psalm-78-20">Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and streams overflowed.<br/>   Can he give bread also?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Will he provide flesh for his people?&#8221;<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:22" id="Psalm-78-22">because they didn&#8217;t believe in God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and didn&#8217;t trust in his salvation.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:23" id="Psalm-78-23">Yet he commanded the skies above,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and opened the doors of heaven.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:24" id="Psalm-78-24">He rained down manna on them to eat,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and gave them food from the sky.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:25" id="Psalm-78-25">Man ate the bread of angels.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He sent them food to the full.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:26" id="Psalm-78-26">He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By his power he guided the south wind.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:27" id="Psalm-78-27">He rained also flesh on them as the dust;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>winged birds as the sand of the seas.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:28" id="Psalm-78-28">He let them fall in the midst of their camp,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>around their habitations.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:29" id="Psalm-78-29">So they ate, and were well filled.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He gave them their own desire.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:30" id="Psalm-78-30">They didn&#8217;t turn from their cravings.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their food was yet in their mouths,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:31" id="Psalm-78-31">when the anger of God went up against them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>killed some of their fattest,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and struck down the young men of Israel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:32" id="Psalm-78-32">For all this they still sinned,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and didn&#8217;t believe in his wondrous works.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:33" id="Psalm-78-33">Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their years in terror.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:34" id="Psalm-78-34">When he killed them, then they inquired after him.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They returned and sought God earnestly.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:35" id="Psalm-78-35">They remembered that God was their rock,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the Most High God, their redeemer.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:36" id="Psalm-78-36">But they flattered him with their mouth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and lied to him with their tongue.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:37" id="Psalm-78-37">For their heart was not right with him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither were they faithful in his covenant.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:38" id="Psalm-78-38">But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn&#8217;t destroy them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yes, many times he turned his anger away,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and didn&#8217;t stir up all his wrath.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:39" id="Psalm-78-39">He remembered that they were but flesh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a wind that passes away, and doesn&#8217;t come again.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:40" id="Psalm-78-40">How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and grieved him in the desert!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:41" id="Psalm-78-41">They turned again and tempted God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:42" id="Psalm-78-42">They didn&#8217;t remember his hand,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:43" id="Psalm-78-43">how he set his signs in Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>his wonders in the field of Zoan,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:44" id="Psalm-78-44">he turned their rivers into blood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their streams, so that they could not drink.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:45" id="Psalm-78-45">He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and frogs, which destroyed them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:46" id="Psalm-78-46">He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their labor to the locust.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:47" id="Psalm-78-47">He destroyed their vines with hail,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>their sycamore fig trees with frost.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:48" id="Psalm-78-48">He gave over their livestock also to the hail,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:49" id="Psalm-78-49">He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>wrath, indignation, and trouble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a band of angels of evil.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:50" id="Psalm-78-50">He made a path for his anger.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He didn&#8217;t spare their soul from death,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but gave their life over to the pestilence,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:51" id="Psalm-78-51">and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:52" id="Psalm-78-52">But he led forth his own people like sheep,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:53" id="Psalm-78-53">He led them safely, so that they weren&#8217;t afraid,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:54" id="Psalm-78-54">He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to this mountain, which his right hand had taken.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:55" id="Psalm-78-55">He also drove out the nations before them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>allotted them for an inheritance by line,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:56" id="Psalm-78-56">Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and didn&#8217;t keep his testimonies;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:57" id="Psalm-78-57">but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:58" id="Psalm-78-58">For they provoked him to anger with their high places,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:59" id="Psalm-78-59">When God heard this, he was angry,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and greatly abhorred Israel;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:60" id="Psalm-78-60">So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the tent which he placed among men;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:61" id="Psalm-78-61">and delivered his strength into captivity,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>his glory into the adversary&#8217;s hand.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:62" id="Psalm-78-62">He also gave his people over to the sword,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and was angry with his inheritance.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:63" id="Psalm-78-63">Fire devoured their young men.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their virgins had no wedding song.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:64" id="Psalm-78-64">Their priests fell by the sword,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their widows couldn&#8217;t weep.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:65" id="Psalm-78-65">Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:66" id="Psalm-78-66">He struck his adversaries backward.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:67" id="Psalm-78-67">Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and didn&#8217;t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:68" id="Psalm-78-68">But chose the tribe of Judah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mount Zion which he loved.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:69" id="Psalm-78-69">He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like the earth which he has established forever.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Psalm 78:70" id="Psalm-78-70">He also chose David his servant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and took him from the sheepfolds;<br/></span>
