  <h2>Hosea 9</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:1" id="Hosea-9-1">Don&#8217;t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for you were unfaithful to your God.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:2" id="Hosea-9-2">The threshing floor and the winepress won&#8217;t feed them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the new wine will fail her.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:3" id="Hosea-9-3">They won&#8217;t dwell in Yahweh&#8217;s land;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but Ephraim will return to Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:4" id="Hosea-9-4">They won&#8217;t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither will they be pleasing to him.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>all who eat of it will be polluted;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for their bread will be for their appetite.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It will not come into the house of Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:5" id="Hosea-9-5">What will you do in the day of solemn assembly,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:6" id="Hosea-9-6">For, behold, they have gone away from destruction.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Egypt will gather them up.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Memphis will bury them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thorns will be in their tents.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:7" id="Hosea-9-7">The days of visitation have come.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The days of reckoning have come.<br/>   Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the man who is inspired to be insane,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because of the abundance of your sins,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and because your hostility is great.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:8" id="Hosea-9-8">A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A fowler&#8217;s snare is on all of his paths,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and hostility in the house of his God.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:9" id="Hosea-9-9">They have deeply corrupted themselves,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as in the days of Gibeah.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will remember their iniquity.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will punish them for their sins.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:10" id="Hosea-9-10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and became abominable like that which they loved.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:11" id="Hosea-9-11">As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There will be no birth, none with child, and no conception.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:12" id="Hosea-9-12">Though they bring up their children,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:13" id="Hosea-9-13">I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:14" id="Hosea-9-14">Give themâ€”Yahweh what will you give?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:15" id="Hosea-9-15">&#8220;All their wickedness is in Gilgal;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for there I hated them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will love them no more.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All their princes are rebels.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:16" id="Hosea-9-16">Ephraim is struck.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their root has dried up.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will bear no fruit.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even though they bring forth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 9:17" id="Hosea-9-17">My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will be wanderers among the nations.<br/></span>
