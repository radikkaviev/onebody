  <h2>Hosea 5</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:1" id="Hosea-5-1">&#8220;Listen to this, you priests!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Listen, house of Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and give ear, house of the king!<br/>   For the judgment is against you;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for you have been a snare at Mizpah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a net spread on Tabor.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:2" id="Hosea-5-2">The rebels are deep in slaughter;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but I discipline all of them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:3" id="Hosea-5-3">I know Ephraim,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Israel is not hidden from me;<br/>   for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Israel is defiled.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:4" id="Hosea-5-4">Their deeds won&#8217;t allow them to turn to their God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the spirit of prostitution is within them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they don&#8217;t know Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:5" id="Hosea-5-5">The pride of Israel testifies to his face.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judah also will stumble with them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:6" id="Hosea-5-6">They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they won&#8217;t find him.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He has withdrawn himself from them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:7" id="Hosea-5-7">They are unfaithful to Yahweh;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for they have borne illegitimate children.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:8" id="Hosea-5-8">&#8220;Blow the cornet in Gibeah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the trumpet in Ramah!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:9" id="Hosea-5-9">Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:10" id="Hosea-5-10">The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will pour out my wrath on them like water.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:11" id="Hosea-5-11">Ephraim is oppressed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he is crushed in judgment;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:12" id="Hosea-5-12">Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to the house of Judah like rottenness.<br/>   <br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:14" id="Hosea-5-14">For I will be to Ephraim like a lion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and like a young lion to the house of Judah.<br/>   I myself will tear in pieces and go away.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 5:15" id="Hosea-5-15">I will go and return to my place,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>until they acknowledge their offense,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and seek my face.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
