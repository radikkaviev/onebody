  <h2>Hosea 2</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:1" id="Hosea-2-1">&#8220;Say to your brothers, &#8216;My people!&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to your sisters, &#8216;My loved one!&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:2" id="Hosea-2-2">Contend with your mother!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Contend, for she is not my wife,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither am I her husband;<br/>   and let her put away her prostitution from her face,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and her adulteries from between her breasts;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:3" id="Hosea-2-3">Lest I strip her naked,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and make her bare as in the day that she was born,<br/>   and make her like a wilderness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and set her like a dry land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and kill her with thirst.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:4" id="Hosea-2-4">Indeed, on her children I will have no mercy;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for they are children of unfaithfulness;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:5" id="Hosea-2-5">For their mother has played the prostitute.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She who conceived them has done shamefully;<br/>   for she said, &#8216;I will go after my lovers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who give me my bread and my water,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>my wool and my flax,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>my oil and my drink.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:6" id="Hosea-2-6">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will build a wall against her,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that she can&#8217;t find her way.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:7" id="Hosea-2-7">She will follow after her lovers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but she won&#8217;t overtake them;<br/>   and she will seek them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but won&#8217;t find them.<br/>   Then she will say, &#8216;I will go and return to my first husband;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for then was it better with me than now.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:8" id="Hosea-2-8">For she did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:9" id="Hosea-2-9">Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and my new wine in its season,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:10" id="Hosea-2-10">Now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and no one will deliver her out of my hand.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:11" id="Hosea-2-11">I will also cause all her celebrations to cease:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:12" id="Hosea-2-12">I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>about which she has said, &#8216;These are my wages that my lovers have given me;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will make them a forest,&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the animals of the field shall eat them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:13" id="Hosea-2-13">I will visit on her the days of the Baals,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to which she burned incense,<br/>   when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and went after her lovers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and forgot me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:14" id="Hosea-2-14">&#8220;Therefore, behold, I will allure her,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and bring her into the wilderness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and speak tenderly to her.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:15" id="Hosea-2-15">I will give her vineyards from there,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the valley of Achor for a door of hope;<br/>   and she will respond there,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as in the days of her youth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:16" id="Hosea-2-16">It will be in that day,&#8221; says Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;that you will call me &#8216;my husband,&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and no longer call me &#8216;my master.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:17" id="Hosea-2-17">For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will no longer be mentioned by name.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:18" id="Hosea-2-18">In that day I will make a covenant for them with the animals of the field,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and with the birds of the sky,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and with the creeping things of the ground.<br/>   I will break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will make them lie down safely.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:19" id="Hosea-2-19">I will betroth you to me forever.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:20" id="Hosea-2-20">I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you shall know Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:21" id="Hosea-2-21">It will happen in that day, I will respond,&#8221; says Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I will respond to the heavens,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will respond to the earth;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:22" id="Hosea-2-22">and the earth will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will respond to Jezreel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 2:23" id="Hosea-2-23">I will sow her to me in the earth;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will tell those who were not my people, &#8216;You are my people;&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will say, &#8216;My God!&#8217;&#8221;<br/></span>
