  <h2>Hosea 4</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:1" id="Hosea-4-1">Hear the word of Yahweh, you children of Israel;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:<br/>   &#8220;Indeed there is no truth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor goodness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor knowledge of God in the land.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:2" id="Hosea-4-2">There is cursing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they break boundaries, and bloodshed causes bloodshed.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:3" id="Hosea-4-3">Therefore the land will mourn,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and everyone who dwells therein will waste away.<br/>   all living things in her,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even the animals of the field and the birds of the sky;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yes, the fish of the sea also die.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:4" id="Hosea-4-4">&#8220;Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let any man accuse; For your people are like those who bring charges against a priest.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:5" id="Hosea-4-5">You will stumble in the day,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will destroy your mother.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:6" id="Hosea-4-6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that you may be no priest to me.<br/>   Because you have forgotten your God&#8217;s law,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will also forget your children.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:7" id="Hosea-4-7">As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will change their glory into shame.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:8" id="Hosea-4-8">They feed on the sin of my people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and set their heart on their iniquity.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:9" id="Hosea-4-9">It will be, like people, like priest;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will punish them for their ways,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will repay them for their deeds.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:10" id="Hosea-4-10">They will eat, and not have enough.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will play the prostitute, and will not increase;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because they have abandoned giving to Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:11" id="Hosea-4-11">Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away understanding.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:12" id="Hosea-4-12">My people consult with their wooden idol,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and answer to a stick of wood.<br/>   Indeed the spirit of prostitution has led them astray,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they have been unfaithful to their God.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:13" id="Hosea-4-13">They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because its shade is good.<br/>   Therefore your daughters play the prostitute,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and your brides commit adultery.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:14" id="Hosea-4-14">I will not punish your daughters when they play the prostitute,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor your brides when they commit adultery;<br/>   because the men consort with prostitutes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they sacrifice with the shrine prostitutes;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so the people without understanding will come to ruin.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:15" id="Hosea-4-15">&#8220;Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet don&#8217;t let Judah offend;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and don&#8217;t come to Gilgal,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither go up to Beth Aven,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor swear, &#8216;As Yahweh lives.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:16" id="Hosea-4-16">For Israel has behaved extremely stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Then how will Yahweh feed them like a lamb in a meadow.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:17" id="Hosea-4-17">Ephraim is joined to idols.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Leave him alone!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:18" id="Hosea-4-18">Their drink has become sour.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They play the prostitute continually.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Her rulers dearly love their shameful way.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 4:19" id="Hosea-4-19">The wind has wrapped her up in its wings;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they shall be disappointed because of their sacrifices.<br/>   <br/></span>
