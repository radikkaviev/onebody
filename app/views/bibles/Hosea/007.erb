  <h2>Hosea 7</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:1" id="Hosea-7-1">When I would heal Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>then the iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>also the wickedness of Samaria;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for they commit falsehood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the thief enters in,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the gang of robbers ravages outside.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:2" id="Hosea-7-2">They don&#8217;t consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now their own deeds have engulfed them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They are before my face.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:3" id="Hosea-7-3">They make the king glad with their wickedness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the princes with their lies.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:4" id="Hosea-7-4">They are all adulterers.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They are burning like an oven that the baker stops stirring,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from the kneading of the dough, until it is leavened.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:5" id="Hosea-7-5">On the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He joined his hand with mockers.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:6" id="Hosea-7-6">For they have prepared their heart like an oven,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>while they lie in wait.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their baker sleeps all the night.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the morning it burns as a flaming fire.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:7" id="Hosea-7-7">They are all hot as an oven,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and devour their judges.<br/>   All their kings have fallen.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is no one among them who calls to me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:8" id="Hosea-7-8">Ephraim, he mixes himself among the nations.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ephraim is a pancake not turned over.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:9" id="Hosea-7-9">Strangers have devoured his strength,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he doesn&#8217;t realize it.<br/>   Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he doesn&#8217;t realize it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:10" id="Hosea-7-10">The pride of Israel testifies to his face;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet they haven&#8217;t returned to Yahweh their God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor sought him, for all this.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:11" id="Hosea-7-11">&#8220;Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They call to Egypt.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They go to Assyria.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:12" id="Hosea-7-12">When they go, I will spread my net on them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:13" id="Hosea-7-13">Woe to them!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For they have wandered from me.<br/>   Destruction to them!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For they have trespassed against me.<br/>   Though I would redeem them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet they have spoken lies against me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:14" id="Hosea-7-14">They haven&#8217;t cried to me with their heart,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they howl on their beds.<br/>   They assemble themselves for grain and new wine.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They turn away from me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:15" id="Hosea-7-15">Though I have taught and strengthened their arms,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet they plot evil against me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 7:16" id="Hosea-7-16">They return, but not to the Most High.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They are like a faulty bow.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their princes will fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.<br/>   <br/></span>
