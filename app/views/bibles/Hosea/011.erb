  <h2>Hosea 11</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:1" id="Hosea-11-1">&#8220;When Israel was a child, then I loved him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and called my son out of Egypt.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:2" id="Hosea-11-2">They called to them, so they went from them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They sacrificed to the Baals,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and burned incense to engraved images.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:3" id="Hosea-11-3">Yet I taught Ephraim to walk.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I took them by his arms;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they didn&#8217;t know that I healed them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:4" id="Hosea-11-4">I drew them with cords of a man, with ties of love;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their necks;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I bent down to him and I fed him.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:5" id="Hosea-11-5">&#8220;They won&#8217;t return into the land of Egypt;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but the Assyrian will be their king,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because they refused to repent.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:6" id="Hosea-11-6">The sword will fall on their cities,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will destroy the bars of their gates,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will put an end to their plans.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:7" id="Hosea-11-7">My people are determined to turn from me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Though they call to the Most High,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he certainly won&#8217;t exalt them.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:8" id="Hosea-11-8">&#8220;How can I give you up, Ephraim?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How can I hand you over, Israel?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How can I make you like Admah?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How can I make you like Zeboiim?<br/>   My heart is turned within me,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>my compassion is aroused.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:9" id="Hosea-11-9">I will not execute the fierceness of my anger.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will not return to destroy Ephraim:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of you;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will not come in wrath.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:10" id="Hosea-11-10">They will walk after Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who will roar like a lion;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for he will roar, and the children will come trembling from the west.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:11" id="Hosea-11-11">They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and like a dove out of the land of Assyria;<br/>   and I will settle them in their houses,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 11:12" id="Hosea-11-12">Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the house of Israel with deceit.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Judah still strays from God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and is unfaithful to the Holy One.<br/></span>
