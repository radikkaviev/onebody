  <h2>Hosea 8</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:1" id="Hosea-8-1">&#8220;Put the trumpet to your lips!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Something like an eagle is over Yahweh&#8217;s house,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because they have broken my covenant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rebelled against my law.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:2" id="Hosea-8-2">They cry to me, &#8216;My God, we Israel acknowledge you!&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:3" id="Hosea-8-3">Israel has cast off that which is good.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The enemy will pursue him.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:4" id="Hosea-8-4">They have set up kings, but not by me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They have made princes, and I didn&#8217;t approve.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that they may be cut off.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:5" id="Hosea-8-5">Let Samaria throw out his calf idol!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My anger burns against them!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How long will it be until they are capable of purity?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:6" id="Hosea-8-6">For this is even from Israel!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The workman made it, and it is no God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>indeed, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:7" id="Hosea-8-7">For they sow the wind,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will reap the whirlwind.<br/>   He has no standing grain.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The stalk will yield no head.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If it does yield, strangers will swallow it up.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:8" id="Hosea-8-8">Israel is swallowed up.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now they are among the nations like a worthless thing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:9" id="Hosea-8-9">For they have gone up to Assyria,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like a wild donkey wandering alone.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ephraim has hired lovers for himself.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:10" id="Hosea-8-10">But although they sold themselves among the nations,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will now gather them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they begin to waste away because of the oppression of the king of mighty ones.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:11" id="Hosea-8-11">Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they became for him altars for sinning.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:12" id="Hosea-8-12">I wrote for him the many things of my law;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they were regarded as a strange thing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:13" id="Hosea-8-13">As for the sacrifices of my offerings,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they sacrifice flesh and eat it;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>But Yahweh doesn&#8217;t accept them.<br/>   Now he will remember their iniquity,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and punish their sins.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will return to Egypt.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hosea 8:14" id="Hosea-8-14">For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Judah has multiplied fortified cities;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but I will send a fire on his cities,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it will devour its fortresses.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
