  <h2>Micah 4</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:1" id="Micah-4-1">But in the latter days,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>it will happen that the mountain of Yahweh&#8217;s temple will be established on the top of the mountains,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it will be exalted above the hills;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and peoples will stream to it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:2" id="Micah-4-2">Many nations will go and say,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to the house of the God of Jacob;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will teach us of his ways,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and we will walk in his paths.&#8221;<br/>   For out of Zion will go forth the law,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:3" id="Micah-4-3">and he will judge between many peoples,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will decide concerning strong nations afar off.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will beat their swords into plowshares,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their spears into pruning hooks.<br/>   Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither will they learn war any more.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:4" id="Micah-4-4">But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and no one will make them afraid:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the mouth of Yahweh of Armies has spoken.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:5" id="Micah-4-5">Indeed all the nations may walk in the name of their gods;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:6" id="Micah-4-6">&#8220;In that day,&#8221; says Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I will assemble that which is lame,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will gather that which is driven away,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and that which I have afflicted;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:7" id="Micah-4-7">and I will make that which was lame a remnant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and that which was cast far off a strong nation:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from then on, even forever.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:8" id="Micah-4-8">You, tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to you it will come,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yes, the former dominion will come,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:9" id="Micah-4-9">Now why do you cry out aloud?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Is there no king in you?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Has your counselor perished,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that pains have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:10" id="Micah-4-10">Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, daughter of Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like a woman in travail;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for now you will go forth out of the city,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will dwell in the field,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will come even to Babylon.<br/>   There you will be rescued.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There Yahweh will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:11" id="Micah-4-11">Now many nations have assembled against you, that say,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Let her be defiled,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and let our eye gloat over Zion.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:12" id="Micah-4-12">But they don&#8217;t know the thoughts of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither do they understand his counsel;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing floor.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 4:13" id="Micah-4-13">Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for I will make your horn iron,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will make your hoofs brass;<br/>   and you will beat in pieces many peoples:<br/>   and I will devote their gain to Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth.<br/></span>
