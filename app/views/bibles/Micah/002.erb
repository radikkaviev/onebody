  <h2>Micah 2</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:1" id="Micah-2-1">Woe to those who devise iniquity<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and work evil on their beds!<br/>   When the morning is light, they practice it,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because it is in the power of their hand.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:2" id="Micah-2-2">They covet fields, and seize them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and houses, and take them away:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they oppress a man and his house,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even a man and his heritage.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:3" id="Micah-2-3">Therefore thus says Yahweh:<br/>   &#8220;Behold, I am planning against these people a disaster,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from which you will not remove your necks,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither will you walk haughtily;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for it is an evil time.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:4" id="Micah-2-4">In that day they will take up a parable against you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and lament with a doleful lamentation, saying,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8216;We are utterly ruined!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My people&#8217;s possession is divided up.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Indeed he takes it from me and assigns our fields to traitors!&#8217;&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:5" id="Micah-2-5">Therefore you will have no one who divides the land by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:6" id="Micah-2-6">&#8220;Don&#8217;t prophesy!&#8221;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They prophesy.<br/>   &#8220;Don&#8217;t prophesy about these things.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Disgrace won&#8217;t overtake us.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:7" id="Micah-2-7">Shall it be said, O house of Jacob:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Is the Spirit of Yahweh angry?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Are these his doings?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Don&#8217;t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:8" id="Micah-2-8">But lately my people have risen up as an enemy.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You strip the robe and clothing from those who pass by without a care, returning from battle.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:9" id="Micah-2-9">You drive the women of my people out from their pleasant houses;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from their young children you take away my blessing forever.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:10" id="Micah-2-10">Arise, and depart!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For this is not your resting place,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because of uncleanness that destroys,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even with a grievous destruction.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:11" id="Micah-2-11">If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood lies:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink;&#8221;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he would be the prophet of this people.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:12" id="Micah-2-12">I will surely assemble, Jacob, all of you;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will surely gather the remnant of Israel;<br/>   I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as a flock in the midst of their pasture;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they will swarm with people.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 2:13" id="Micah-2-13">He who breaks open the way goes up before them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They break through the gate, and go out.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And their king passes on before them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>with Yahweh at their head.<br/></span>
