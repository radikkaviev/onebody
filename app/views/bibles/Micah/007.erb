  <h2>Micah 7</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:1" id="Micah-7-1">Misery is mine!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Indeed, I am like one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is no cluster of grapes to eat.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My soul desires to eat the early fig.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:2" id="Micah-7-2">The godly man has perished out of the earth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and there is no one upright among men.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They all lie in wait for blood;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>every man hunts his brother with a net.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:3" id="Micah-7-3">Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The ruler and judge ask for a bribe;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Thus they conspire together.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:4" id="Micah-7-4">The best of them is like a brier.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.<br/>   The day of your watchmen,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even your visitation, has come;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>now is the time of their confusion.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:5" id="Micah-7-5">Don&#8217;t trust in a neighbor.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Don&#8217;t put confidence in a friend.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>With the woman lying in your embrace,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>be careful of the words of your mouth!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:6" id="Micah-7-6">For the son dishonors the father,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the daughter rises up against her mother,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a man&#8217;s enemies are the men of his own house.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:7" id="Micah-7-7">But as for me, I will look to Yahweh.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will wait for the God of my salvation.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My God will hear me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:8" id="Micah-7-8">Don&#8217;t rejoice against me, my enemy.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I fall, I will arise.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:9" id="Micah-7-9">I will bear the indignation of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because I have sinned against him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>until he pleads my case, and executes judgment for me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will bring me forth to the light.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will see his righteousness.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:10" id="Micah-7-10">Then my enemy will see it,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and shame will cover her who said to me,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>where is Yahweh your God?<br/>   Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now she will be trodden down like the mire of the streets.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:11" id="Micah-7-11">A day to build your wallsâ€”<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In that day, he will extend your boundary.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:12" id="Micah-7-12">In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from Egypt even to the River,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from sea to sea,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and mountain to mountain.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:13" id="Micah-7-13">Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell therein,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the fruit of their doings.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:14" id="Micah-7-14">Shepherd your people with your staff,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the flock of your heritage,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who dwell by themselves in a forest,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in the midst of fertile pasture land, let them feed;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:15" id="Micah-7-15">&#8220;As in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will show them marvelous things.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:16" id="Micah-7-16">The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will lay their hand on their mouth.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their ears will be deaf.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:17" id="Micah-7-17">They will lick the dust like a serpent.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their dens.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They will come with fear to Yahweh our God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will be afraid because of you.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:18" id="Micah-7-18">Who is a God like you, who pardons iniquity,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and passes over the disobedience of the remnant of his heritage?<br/>   He doesn&#8217;t retain his anger forever,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because he delights in loving kindness.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:19" id="Micah-7-19">He will again have compassion on us.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will tread our iniquities under foot;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 7:20" id="Micah-7-20">You will give truth to Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and mercy to Abraham,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.<br/></span>
