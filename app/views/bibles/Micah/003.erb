  <h2>Micah 3</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:1" id="Micah-3-1">I said,  &#8220;Please listen, you heads of Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rulers of the house of Israel:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Isn&#8217;t it for you to know justice?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:2" id="Micah-3-2">You who hate the good,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and love the evil;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who tear off their skin,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their flesh from off their bones;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:3" id="Micah-3-3">who also eat the flesh of my people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and flay their skin from off them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and break their bones,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and chop them in pieces, as for the pot,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as flesh within the caldron.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:4" id="Micah-3-4">Then they will cry to Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but he will not answer them.<br/>   Yes, he will hide his face from them at that time,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because they made their deeds evil.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:5" id="Micah-3-5">Thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who lead my people astray; for those who feed their teeth, they proclaim, &#8220;Peace!&#8221; and whoever doesn&#8217;t provide for their mouths, they prepare war against him:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:6" id="Micah-3-6">&#8220;Therefore night is over you, with no vision,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it is dark to you, that you may not divine;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the sun will go down on the prophets,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the day will be black over them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:7" id="Micah-3-7">The seers shall be disappointed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the diviners confounded.<br/>   Yes, they shall all cover their lips;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for there is no answer from God.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:8" id="Micah-3-8">But as for me, I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and of judgment, and of might,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to declare to Jacob his disobedience,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to Israel his sin.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:9" id="Micah-3-9">Please listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rulers of the house of Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who abhor justice,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and pervert all equity.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:10" id="Micah-3-10">They build up Zion with blood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Jerusalem with iniquity.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:11" id="Micah-3-11">Her leaders judge for bribes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and her priests teach for a price,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and her prophets of it tell fortunes for money:<br/>   yet they lean on Yahweh, and say,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Yahweh in the midst of us?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No disaster will come on us.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Micah 3:12" id="Micah-3-12">Therefore Zion for your sake will be plowed like a field,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the mountain of the temple like the high places of a forest.<br/></span>
