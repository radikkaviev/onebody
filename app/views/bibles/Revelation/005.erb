  <h2>Revelation 5</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:1" id="Revelation-5-1">I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:2" id="Revelation-5-2">I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &#8220;Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:3" id="Revelation-5-3">No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:4" id="Revelation-5-4">And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:5" id="Revelation-5-5">One of the elders said to me, &#8220;Don&#8217;t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome; he who opens the book and its seven seals.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:6" id="Revelation-5-6">I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:7" id="Revelation-5-7">Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:8" id="Revelation-5-8">Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:9" id="Revelation-5-9">They sang a new song, saying,  &#8220;You are worthy to take the book,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to open its seals:<br/>   for you were killed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and bought us for God with your blood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:10" id="Revelation-5-10">and made us kings and priests to our God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and we will reign on earth.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:11" id="Revelation-5-11">I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:12" id="Revelation-5-12">saying with a loud voice, &#8220;Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:13" id="Revelation-5-13">I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, &#8220;To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever! Amen!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Revelation 5:14" id="Revelation-5-14">The four living creatures said, &#8220;Amen!&#8221; The elders fell down and worshiped.</span>
