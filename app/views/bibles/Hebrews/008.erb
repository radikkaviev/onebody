  <h2>Hebrews 8</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:1" id="Hebrews-8-1">Now in the things which we are saying, the main point is this. We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:2" id="Hebrews-8-2">a servant of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:3" id="Hebrews-8-3">For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:4" id="Hebrews-8-4">For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:5" id="Hebrews-8-5">who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, &#8220;See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:6" id="Hebrews-8-6">But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:7" id="Hebrews-8-7">For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:8" id="Hebrews-8-8">For finding fault with them, he said,  &#8220;Behold, the days come,&#8221; says the Lord,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:9" id="Hebrews-8-9">not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt;<br/>   for they didn&#8217;t continue in my covenant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I disregarded them,&#8221; says the Lord.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:10" id="Hebrews-8-10">&#8220;For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>After those days,&#8221; says the Lord;<br/>   &#8220;I will put my laws into their mind,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will also write them on their heart.<br/>   I will be their God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will be my people.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:11" id="Hebrews-8-11">They will not teach every man his fellow citizen,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and every man his brother, saying, &#8216;Know the Lord,&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for all will know me,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from their least to their greatest.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:12" id="Hebrews-8-12">For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no more.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Hebrews 8:13" id="Hebrews-8-13">In that he says, &#8220;A new covenant,&#8221; he has made the first old. But that which is becoming old and grows aged is near to vanishing away.</span>
