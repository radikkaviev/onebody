  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:15" id="Lamentations-1-15">The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me;<br/>   He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men:<br/>   The Lord has trodden as in a winepress the virgin daughter of Judah.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:16" id="Lamentations-1-16">For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water;<br/>   Because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me:<br/>   My children are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:17" id="Lamentations-1-17">Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her;<br/>   Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are around him should be his adversaries:<br/>   Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:20" id="Lamentations-1-20">See, Yahweh; for I am in distress; my heart is troubled;<br/>   My heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled:<br/>   Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:21" id="Lamentations-1-21">They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me;<br/>   All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it:<br/>   You will bring the day that you have proclaimed, and they shall be like me.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Lamentations 1:22" id="Lamentations-1-22">Let all their wickedness come before you;<br/>   Do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions:<br/>   For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.<br/></span>
