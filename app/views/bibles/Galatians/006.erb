  <h2>Galatians 6</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:1" id="Galatians-6-1">Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren&#8217;t tempted.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:2" id="Galatians-6-2">Bear one another&#8217;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:3" id="Galatians-6-3">For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:4" id="Galatians-6-4">But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:5" id="Galatians-6-5">For each man will bear his own burden.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:6" id="Galatians-6-6">But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:7" id="Galatians-6-7">Don&#8217;t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:8" id="Galatians-6-8">For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:9" id="Galatians-6-9">Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don&#8217;t give up.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:10" id="Galatians-6-10">So then, as we have opportunity, let&#8217;s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:11" id="Galatians-6-11">See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:12" id="Galatians-6-12">As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:13" id="Galatians-6-13">For even they who receive circumcision don&#8217;t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:14" id="Galatians-6-14">But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:15" id="Galatians-6-15">For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:16" id="Galatians-6-16">As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God&#8217;s Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:17" id="Galatians-6-17">From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Galatians 6:18" id="Galatians-6-18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</span>
