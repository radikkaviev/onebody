  <h2>Jeremiah 14</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:1" id="Jeremiah-14-1">The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:2" id="Jeremiah-14-2">Judah mourns, and its gates languish, they sit in black on the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:3" id="Jeremiah-14-3">Their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the cisterns, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty; they are disappointed and confounded, and cover their heads.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:4" id="Jeremiah-14-4">Because of the ground which is cracked, because no rain has been in the land, the plowmen are disappointed, they cover their heads.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:5" id="Jeremiah-14-5">Yes, the hind also in the field calves, and forsakes her young, because there is no grass.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:6" id="Jeremiah-14-6">The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:7" id="Jeremiah-14-7">Though our iniquities testify against us, work for your name&#8217;s sake, Yahweh; for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:8" id="Jeremiah-14-8">You hope of Israel, its Savior in the time of trouble, why should you be as a foreigner in the land, and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:9" id="Jeremiah-14-9">Why should you be like a scared man, as a mighty man who can&#8217;t save? Yet you, Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don&#8217;t leave us.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:10" id="Jeremiah-14-10">Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:11" id="Jeremiah-14-11">Yahweh said to me, Don&#8217;t pray for this people for their good.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:12" id="Jeremiah-14-12">When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:13" id="Jeremiah-14-13">Then I said, Ah, Lord Yahweh! behold, the prophets tell them, You shall not see the sword, neither shall you have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:14" id="Jeremiah-14-14">Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I didn&#8217;t send them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoke I to them: they prophesy to you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:15" id="Jeremiah-14-15">Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name, and I didn&#8217;t send them, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:16" id="Jeremiah-14-16">The people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury themâ€”them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:17" id="Jeremiah-14-17">You shall say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:18" id="Jeremiah-14-18">If I go forth into the field, then, behold, the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then, behold, those who are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:19" id="Jeremiah-14-19">Have you utterly rejected Judah? has your soul loathed Zion? why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold, dismay!</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:20" id="Jeremiah-14-20">We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:21" id="Jeremiah-14-21">Do not abhor us, for your name&#8217;s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don&#8217;t break your covenant with us.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 14:22" id="Jeremiah-14-22">Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren&#8217;t you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.</span>
