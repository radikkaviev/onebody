  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 30:2" id="Jeremiah-30-2">Thus speaks Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 30:3" id="Jeremiah-30-3">For, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, says Yahweh; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 30:6" id="Jeremiah-30-6">Ask now, and see whether a man does travail with child: why do I see every man with his hands on his waist, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 30:7" id="Jeremiah-30-7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob&#8217;s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span>
