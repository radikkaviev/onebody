  <h2>Jeremiah 12</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:1" id="Jeremiah-12-1">You are righteous, Yahweh, when I contend with you; yet I would reason the cause with you: why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they at ease who deal very treacherously?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:2" id="Jeremiah-12-2">You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:3" id="Jeremiah-12-3">But you, Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:4" id="Jeremiah-12-4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of those who dwell therein, the animals are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:5" id="Jeremiah-12-5">If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? and though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:6" id="Jeremiah-12-6">For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have dealt treacherously with you; even they have cried aloud after you: don&#8217;t believe them, though they speak beautiful words to you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:7" id="Jeremiah-12-7">I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:8" id="Jeremiah-12-8">My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:9" id="Jeremiah-12-9">Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her all around? Go, assemble all the animals of the field, bring them to devour.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:10" id="Jeremiah-12-10">Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:11" id="Jeremiah-12-11">They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:12" id="Jeremiah-12-12">Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:13" id="Jeremiah-12-13">They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:14" id="Jeremiah-12-14">Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:15" id="Jeremiah-12-15">It shall happen, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:16" id="Jeremiah-12-16">It shall happen, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 12:17" id="Jeremiah-12-17">But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.</span>
