  <h2>Jeremiah 20</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:1" id="Jeremiah-20-1">Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:2" id="Jeremiah-20-2">Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:3" id="Jeremiah-20-3">It happened on the next day, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said to him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magormissabib.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:4" id="Jeremiah-20-4">For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes shall see it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall kill them with the sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:5" id="Jeremiah-20-5">Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all the precious things of it, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:6" id="Jeremiah-20-6">You, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house shall go into captivity; and you shall come to Babylon, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:7" id="Jeremiah-20-7">Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocks me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:8" id="Jeremiah-20-8">For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of Yahweh is made a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:9" id="Jeremiah-20-9">If I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can&#8217;t.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:10" id="Jeremiah-20-10">For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, those who watch for my fall; perhaps he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:11" id="Jeremiah-20-11">But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly disappointed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:12" id="Jeremiah-20-12">But, Yahweh of Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you have I revealed my cause.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:13" id="Jeremiah-20-13">Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:14" id="Jeremiah-20-14">Cursed is the day in which I was born: don&#8217;t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:15" id="Jeremiah-20-15">Cursed is the man who brought news to my father, saying, A boy is born to you; making him very glad.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:16" id="Jeremiah-20-16">Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn&#8217;t repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:17" id="Jeremiah-20-17">because he didn&#8217;t kill me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 20:18" id="Jeremiah-20-18">Why came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span>
