  <h2>Jeremiah 6</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:1" id="Jeremiah-6-1">&#8220;Flee for safety, you children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth Haccherem; for evil looks forth from the north, and a great destruction.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:2" id="Jeremiah-6-2">The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:3" id="Jeremiah-6-3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her all around; they shall feed everyone in his place.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:4" id="Jeremiah-6-4">&#8220;Prepare war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:5" id="Jeremiah-6-5">Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:6" id="Jeremiah-6-6">For Yahweh of Armies said, &#8220;Cut down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:7" id="Jeremiah-6-7">As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:8" id="Jeremiah-6-8">Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:9" id="Jeremiah-6-9">Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &#8220;They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel like a vine. Turn again your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:10" id="Jeremiah-6-10">To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can&#8217;t listen. Behold, the word of Yahweh has become a reproach to them. They have no delight in it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:11" id="Jeremiah-6-11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh. I am weary with holding in.  &#8220;Pour it out on the children in the street,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and on the assembly of young men together;<br/>   for even the husband with the wife shall be taken,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the aged with him who is full of days.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:12" id="Jeremiah-6-12">Their houses shall be turned to others,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>their fields and their wives together;<br/>   for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:13" id="Jeremiah-6-13">&#8220;For from their least even to their greatest, everyone is given to covetousness;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from the prophet even to the priest, everyone deals falsely.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:14" id="Jeremiah-6-14">They have healed also the hurt of my people superficially,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>saying, &#8216;Peace, peace!&#8217; when there is no peace.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:15" id="Jeremiah-6-15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush.<br/>   Therefore they shall fall among those who fall;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>at the time that I visit them, they shall be cast down,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:16" id="Jeremiah-6-16">Thus says Yahweh, &#8220;Stand in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, &#8216;Where is the good way?&#8217; and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But they said, &#8216;We will not walk in it.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:17" id="Jeremiah-6-17">I set watchmen over you, saying, &#8216;Listen to the sound of the trumpet!&#8217; But they said, &#8216;We will not listen!&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:18" id="Jeremiah-6-18">Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:19" id="Jeremiah-6-19">Hear, earth! Behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:20" id="Jeremiah-6-20">To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:21" id="Jeremiah-6-21">Therefore thus says Yahweh, &#8220;Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people. The fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them. The neighbor and his friend shall perish.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:22" id="Jeremiah-6-22">Thus says Yahweh, &#8220;Behold, a people comes from the north country. A great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:23" id="Jeremiah-6-23">They take hold of bow and spear. They are cruel, and have no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:24" id="Jeremiah-6-24">We have heard its report; our hands become feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pains as of a woman in labor.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:25" id="Jeremiah-6-25">Don&#8217;t go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and terror, are on every side.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:26" id="Jeremiah-6-26">Daughter of my people, clothe yourself with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes! Mourn, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:27" id="Jeremiah-6-27">&#8220;I have made you a tester of metals and a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:28" id="Jeremiah-6-28">They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:29" id="Jeremiah-6-29">The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Jeremiah 6:30" id="Jeremiah-6-30">Men will call them rejected silver, because Yahweh has rejected them.&#8221;</span>
