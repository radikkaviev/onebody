  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 12:9" id="Ecclesiastes-12-9">Further, because the Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 12:10" id="Ecclesiastes-12-10">The Preacher sought to find out acceptable words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 12:11" id="Ecclesiastes-12-11">The words of the wise are like goads; and like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 12:14" id="Ecclesiastes-12-14">For God will bring every work into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is evil.</span>
