  <h2>Ecclesiastes 4</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:1" id="Ecclesiastes-4-1">Then I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:2" id="Ecclesiastes-4-2">Therefore I praised the dead who have been long dead more than the living who are yet alive.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:3" id="Ecclesiastes-4-3">Yes, better than them both is him who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:4" id="Ecclesiastes-4-4">Then I saw all the labor and achievement that is the envy of a man&#8217;s neighbor. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:5" id="Ecclesiastes-4-5">The fool folds his hands together and ruins himself.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:6" id="Ecclesiastes-4-6">Better is a handful, with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:7" id="Ecclesiastes-4-7">Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:8" id="Ecclesiastes-4-8">There is one who is alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. &#8220;For whom then, do I labor, and deprive my soul of enjoyment?&#8221; This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:9" id="Ecclesiastes-4-9">Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:10" id="Ecclesiastes-4-10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn&#8217;t have another to lift him up.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:11" id="Ecclesiastes-4-11">Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:12" id="Ecclesiastes-4-12">If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:13" id="Ecclesiastes-4-13">Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn&#8217;t know how to receive admonition any more.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:14" id="Ecclesiastes-4-14">For out of prison he came forth to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:15" id="Ecclesiastes-4-15">I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ecclesiastes 4:16" id="Ecclesiastes-4-16">There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he wasâ€”yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</span>
