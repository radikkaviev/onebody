  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:2" id="Numbers-36-2">and they said, &#8220;Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:3" id="Numbers-36-3">If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:4" id="Numbers-36-4">When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong: so will their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:5" id="Numbers-36-5">Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Yahweh, saying, &#8220;The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:7" id="Numbers-36-7">So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Numbers 36:8" id="Numbers-36-8">Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.</span>
