  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:1" id="Leviticus-16-1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they drew near before Yahweh, and died;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:2" id="Leviticus-16-2">and Yahweh said to Moses, &#8220;Tell Aaron your brother, not to come at all times into the Most Holy Place within the veil, before the mercy seat which is on the ark; lest he die: for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:3" id="Leviticus-16-3">&#8220;Herewith shall Aaron come into the sanctuary: with a young bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:4" id="Leviticus-16-4">He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches on his body, and shall put on the linen sash, and he shall be clothed with the linen turban. They are the holy garments. He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:5" id="Leviticus-16-5">He shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:6" id="Leviticus-16-6">&#8220;Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:9" id="Leviticus-16-9">Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh, and offer him for a sin offering.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:10" id="Leviticus-16-10">But the goat, on which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him, to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:12" id="Leviticus-16-12">He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar before Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:13" id="Leviticus-16-13">and he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on the testimony, so that he will not die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:14" id="Leviticus-16-14">He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:15" id="Leviticus-16-15">&#8220;Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for the people, and bring his blood within the veil, and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:16" id="Leviticus-16-16">and he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, even all their sins; and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells with them in the midst of their uncleanness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:17" id="Leviticus-16-17">No one shall be in the Tent of Meeting when he enters to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out, and has made atonement for himself and for his household, and for all the assembly of Israel.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:19" id="Leviticus-16-19">He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:21" id="Leviticus-16-21">Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is in readiness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:22" id="Leviticus-16-22">The goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:28" id="Leviticus-16-28">He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:29" id="Leviticus-16-29">&#8220;It shall be a statute to you forever: in the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls, and shall do no kind of work, the native-born, or the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 16:30" id="Leviticus-16-30">for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you shall be clean before Yahweh.</span>
