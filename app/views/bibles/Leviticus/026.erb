  <h2>Leviticus 26</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:1" id="Leviticus-26-1">&#8220;&#8216;You shall make for yourselves no idols, neither shall you raise up an engraved image or a pillar, neither shall you place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it: for I am Yahweh your God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:2" id="Leviticus-26-2">&#8220;&#8216;You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary. I am Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:3" id="Leviticus-26-3">&#8220;&#8216;If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:4" id="Leviticus-26-4">then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:5" id="Leviticus-26-5">Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:6" id="Leviticus-26-6">&#8220;&#8216;I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and no one will make you afraid; and I will remove evil animals out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:7" id="Leviticus-26-7">You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:8" id="Leviticus-26-8">Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:9" id="Leviticus-26-9">&#8220;&#8216;I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:10" id="Leviticus-26-10">You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out the old because of the new.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:11" id="Leviticus-26-11">I will set my tent among you: and my soul won&#8217;t abhor you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:12" id="Leviticus-26-12">I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will be my people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:13" id="Leviticus-26-13">I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:14" id="Leviticus-26-14">&#8220;&#8216;But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:15" id="Leviticus-26-15">and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:16" id="Leviticus-26-16">I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:17" id="Leviticus-26-17">I will set my face against you, and you will be struck before your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you; and you will flee when no one pursues you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:18" id="Leviticus-26-18">&#8220;&#8216;If you in spite of these things will not listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:19" id="Leviticus-26-19">I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron, and your soil like brass;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:20" id="Leviticus-26-20">and your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won&#8217;t yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:21" id="Leviticus-26-21">&#8220;&#8216;If you walk contrary to me, and won&#8217;t listen to me, then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:22" id="Leviticus-26-22">I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few in number; and your roads will become desolate.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:23" id="Leviticus-26-23">&#8220;&#8216;If by these things you won&#8217;t be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:24" id="Leviticus-26-24">then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:25" id="Leviticus-26-25">I will bring a sword upon you, that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you will be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:26" id="Leviticus-26-26">When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:27" id="Leviticus-26-27">&#8220;&#8216;If you in spite of this won&#8217;t listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:28" id="Leviticus-26-28">then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:29" id="Leviticus-26-29">You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:30" id="Leviticus-26-30">I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul will abhor you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:31" id="Leviticus-26-31">I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:32" id="Leviticus-26-32">I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein will be astonished at it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:33" id="Leviticus-26-33">I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land will be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:34" id="Leviticus-26-34">Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies&#8217; land. Even then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:35" id="Leviticus-26-35">As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn&#8217;t have in your sabbaths, when you lived on it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:36" id="Leviticus-26-36">&#8220;&#8216;As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when no one pursues.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:37" id="Leviticus-26-37">They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword, when no one pursues: and you will have no power to stand before your enemies.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:38" id="Leviticus-26-38">You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will eat you up.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:39" id="Leviticus-26-39">Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies&#8217; lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:40" id="Leviticus-26-40">&#8220;&#8216;If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:41" id="Leviticus-26-41">I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:42" id="Leviticus-26-42">then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham; and I will remember the land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:43" id="Leviticus-26-43">The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:44" id="Leviticus-26-44">Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:45" id="Leviticus-26-45">but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am Yahweh.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 26:46" id="Leviticus-26-46">These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</span>
