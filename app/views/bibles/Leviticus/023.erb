  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:2" id="Leviticus-23-2">&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, &#8216;The set feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:3" id="Leviticus-23-3">&#8220;&#8216;Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:4" id="Leviticus-23-4">&#8220;&#8216;These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:10" id="Leviticus-23-10">&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, &#8216;When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its the harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:11" id="Leviticus-23-11">and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:12" id="Leviticus-23-12">On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:13" id="Leviticus-23-13">The meal offering with it shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:14" id="Leviticus-23-14">You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:15" id="Leviticus-23-15">&#8220;&#8216;You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:16" id="Leviticus-23-16">even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall number fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:17" id="Leviticus-23-17">You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:18" id="Leviticus-23-18">You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, one young bull, and two rams.

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:19" id="Leviticus-23-19">You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:20" id="Leviticus-23-20">The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:21" id="Leviticus-23-21">You shall make proclamation on the same day: there shall be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular work. This is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:22" id="Leviticus-23-22">&#8220;&#8216;When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest: you shall leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:23" id="Leviticus-23-23">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:24" id="Leviticus-23-24">&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, saying, &#8216;In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:26" id="Leviticus-23-26">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:27" id="Leviticus-23-27">&#8220;However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:28" id="Leviticus-23-28">You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:29" id="Leviticus-23-29">For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:30" id="Leviticus-23-30">Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:31" id="Leviticus-23-31">You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:32" id="Leviticus-23-32">It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:33" id="Leviticus-23-33">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:34" id="Leviticus-23-34">&#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, and say, &#8216;On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:35" id="Leviticus-23-35">On the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:36" id="Leviticus-23-36">Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:37" id="Leviticus-23-37">&#8220;&#8216;These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:38" id="Leviticus-23-38">besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:39" id="Leviticus-23-39">&#8220;&#8216;So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:40" id="Leviticus-23-40">You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:43" id="Leviticus-23-43">that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Leviticus 23:44" id="Leviticus-23-44">Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.</span>
