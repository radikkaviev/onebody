  <h2>2 Chronicles 29</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:1" id="2_Chronicles-29-1">Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old; and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem: and his mother&#8217;s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:2" id="2_Chronicles-29-2">He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that David his father had done.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:3" id="2_Chronicles-29-3">He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of Yahweh, and repaired them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:4" id="2_Chronicles-29-4">He brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:5" id="2_Chronicles-29-5">and said to them, &#8220;Listen to me, you Levites! Now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and carry out the filthiness out of the holy place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:6" id="2_Chronicles-29-6">For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of Yahweh, and turned their backs.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:7" id="2_Chronicles-29-7">Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:8" id="2_Chronicles-29-8">Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem, and he has delivered them to be tossed back and forth, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as you see with your eyes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:9" id="2_Chronicles-29-9">For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:10" id="2_Chronicles-29-10">Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:11" id="2_Chronicles-29-11">My sons, don&#8217;t be negligent now; for Yahweh has chosen you to stand before him, to minister to him, and that you should be his ministers, and burn incense.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:12" id="2_Chronicles-29-12">Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:13" id="2_Chronicles-29-13">and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:14" id="2_Chronicles-29-14">and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:15" id="2_Chronicles-29-15">They gathered their brothers, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:16" id="2_Chronicles-29-16">The priests went in to the inner part of the house of Yahweh, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Yahweh into the court of the house of Yahweh. The Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:17" id="2_Chronicles-29-17">Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of Yahweh; and they sanctified the house of Yahweh in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:18" id="2_Chronicles-29-18">Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, &#8220;We have cleansed all the house of Yahweh, and the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels, and the table of show bread, with all its vessels.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:19" id="2_Chronicles-29-19">Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign threw away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and behold, they are before the altar of Yahweh.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:20" id="2_Chronicles-29-20">Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:21" id="2_Chronicles-29-21">They brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah.

  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:22" id="2_Chronicles-29-22">So they killed the bulls, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:23" id="2_Chronicles-29-23">They brought near the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands on them:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:24" id="2_Chronicles-29-24">and the priests killed them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:25" id="2_Chronicles-29-25">He set the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, with stringed instruments, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king&#8217;s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Yahweh by his prophets.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:26" id="2_Chronicles-29-26">The Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:27" id="2_Chronicles-29-27">Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David king of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:28" id="2_Chronicles-29-28">All the assembly worshiped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:29" id="2_Chronicles-29-29">When they had made an end of offering, the king and all who were present with him bowed themselves and worshiped.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:30" id="2_Chronicles-29-30">Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises to Yahweh with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. They sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshiped.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:31" id="2_Chronicles-29-31">Then Hezekiah answered, &#8220;Now you have consecrated yourselves to Yahweh; come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of Yahweh.&#8221; The assembly brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt offerings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:32" id="2_Chronicles-29-32">The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:33" id="2_Chronicles-29-33">The consecrated things were six hundred head of cattle and three thousand sheep.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:34" id="2_Chronicles-29-34">But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: therefore their brothers the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:35" id="2_Chronicles-29-35">Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of Yahweh was set in order.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 29:36" id="2_Chronicles-29-36">Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</span>
