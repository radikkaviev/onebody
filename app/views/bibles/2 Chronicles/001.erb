  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:2" id="2_Chronicles-1-2">Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers&#8217; households.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:3" id="2_Chronicles-1-3">So Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the Tent of Meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh had made in the wilderness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:4" id="2_Chronicles-1-4">But David had brought the ark of God up from Kiriath Jearim to the place that David had prepared for it; for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:5" id="2_Chronicles-1-5">Moreover the bronze altar, that Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh: and Solomon and the assembly were seeking counsel there.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:6" id="2_Chronicles-1-6">Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the Tent of Meeting, and offered one thousand burnt offerings on it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:7" id="2_Chronicles-1-7">In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, &#8220;Ask what I shall give you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:8" id="2_Chronicles-1-8">Solomon said to God, &#8220;You have shown great loving kindness to David my father, and have made me king in his place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:9" id="2_Chronicles-1-9">Now, Yahweh God, let your promise to David my father be established; for you have made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:10" id="2_Chronicles-1-10">Now give me wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people; for who can judge this your people, that is so great?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:11" id="2_Chronicles-1-11">God said to Solomon, &#8220;Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked riches, wealth, or honor, nor the life of those who hate you, neither yet have asked long life; but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself, that you may judge my people, over whom I have made you king:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:12" id="2_Chronicles-1-12">wisdom and knowledge is granted to you. I will give you riches, wealth, and honor, such as none of the kings have had who have been before you; neither shall there any after you have the like.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:13" id="2_Chronicles-1-13">So Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the Tent of Meeting, to Jerusalem; and he reigned over Israel.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:15" id="2_Chronicles-1-15">The king made silver and gold to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:16" id="2_Chronicles-1-16">The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt and from Kue; the king&#8217;s merchants purchased them from Kue.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Chronicles 1:17" id="2_Chronicles-1-17">They brought up and brought out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Syria, they brought them out by their means.</span>
