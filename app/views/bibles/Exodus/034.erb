  <h2>Exodus 34</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:1" id="Exodus-34-1">Yahweh said to Moses, &#8220;Chisel two stone tablets like the first: and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:2" id="Exodus-34-2">Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:3" id="Exodus-34-3">No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mountain.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:4" id="Exodus-34-4">He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:5" id="Exodus-34-5">Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:6" id="Exodus-34-6">Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, &#8220;Yahweh! Yahweh, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness and truth,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:7" id="Exodus-34-7">keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the children&#8217;s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:8" id="Exodus-34-8">Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:9" id="Exodus-34-9">He said, &#8220;If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:10" id="Exodus-34-10">He said, &#8220;Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I do with you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:11" id="Exodus-34-11">Observe that which I command you this day. Behold, I drive out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:12" id="Exodus-34-12">Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare in the midst of you:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:13" id="Exodus-34-13">but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:14" id="Exodus-34-14">for you shall worship no other god: for Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:15" id="Exodus-34-15">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:16" id="Exodus-34-16">and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play the prostitute after their gods.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:17" id="Exodus-34-17">&#8220;You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:18" id="Exodus-34-18">&#8220;You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:19" id="Exodus-34-19">&#8220;All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:20" id="Exodus-34-20">The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem. No one shall appear before me empty.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:21" id="Exodus-34-21">&#8220;Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest: in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:22" id="Exodus-34-22">&#8220;You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year&#8217;s end.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:23" id="Exodus-34-23">Three times in the year all your males shall appear before the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:24" id="Exodus-34-24">For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:25" id="Exodus-34-25">&#8220;You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:26" id="Exodus-34-26">&#8220;You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of Yahweh your God. &#8220;You shall not boil a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:27" id="Exodus-34-27">Yahweh said to Moses, &#8220;Write you these words: for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:28" id="Exodus-34-28">He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:29" id="Exodus-34-29">It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in Moses&#8217; hand, when he came down from the mountain, that Moses didn&#8217;t know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:30" id="Exodus-34-30">When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:31" id="Exodus-34-31">Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:32" id="Exodus-34-32">Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him on Mount Sinai.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:33" id="Exodus-34-33">When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:34" id="Exodus-34-34">But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Exodus 34:35" id="Exodus-34-35">The children of Israel saw Moses&#8217; face, that the skin of Moses&#8217; face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span>
