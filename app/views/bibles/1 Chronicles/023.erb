  <h2>1 Chronicles 23</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:1" id="1_Chronicles-23-1">Now David was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:2" id="1_Chronicles-23-2">He gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:3" id="1_Chronicles-23-3">The Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:4" id="1_Chronicles-23-4">David said, &#8220;Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Yahweh; six thousand were officers and judges;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:5" id="1_Chronicles-23-5">four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised Yahweh with the instruments which I made, for giving praise.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:6" id="1_Chronicles-23-6">David divided them into divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:7" id="1_Chronicles-23-7">Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:8" id="1_Chronicles-23-8">The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:9" id="1_Chronicles-23-9">The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers&#8217; households of Ladan.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:10" id="1_Chronicles-23-10">The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:11" id="1_Chronicles-23-11">Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah didn&#8217;t have many sons; therefore they became a fathers&#8217; house in one reckoning.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:12" id="1_Chronicles-23-12">The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:13" id="1_Chronicles-23-13">The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, forever, to burn incense before Yahweh, to minister to him, and to bless in his name, forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:14" id="1_Chronicles-23-14">But as for Moses the man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:15" id="1_Chronicles-23-15">The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:16" id="1_Chronicles-23-16">The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:17" id="1_Chronicles-23-17">The sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:18" id="1_Chronicles-23-18">The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:19" id="1_Chronicles-23-19">The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:20" id="1_Chronicles-23-20">The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:21" id="1_Chronicles-23-21">The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:22" id="1_Chronicles-23-22">Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as wives.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:23" id="1_Chronicles-23-23">The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:24" id="1_Chronicles-23-24">These were the sons of Levi after their fathers&#8217; houses, even the heads of the fathers&#8217; houses of those who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of Yahweh, from twenty years old and upward.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:25" id="1_Chronicles-23-25">For David said, &#8220;Yahweh, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:26" id="1_Chronicles-23-26">Also the Levites will no longer need to carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:27" id="1_Chronicles-23-27">For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:28" id="1_Chronicles-23-28">For their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Yahweh, in the courts, and in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of God;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:29" id="1_Chronicles-23-29">for the show bread also, and for the fine flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all kinds of measure and size;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:30" id="1_Chronicles-23-30">and to stand every morning to thank and praise Yahweh, and likewise in the evening;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:31" id="1_Chronicles-23-31">and to offer all burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the Sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before Yahweh;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 23:32" id="1_Chronicles-23-32">and that they should keep the duty of the Tent of Meeting, and the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of Aaron their brothers, for the service of the house of Yahweh.</span>
