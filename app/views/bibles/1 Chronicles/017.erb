  <h2>1 Chronicles 17</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:1" id="1_Chronicles-17-1">It happened, when David lived in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, &#8220;Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under curtains.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:2" id="1_Chronicles-17-2">Nathan said to David, &#8220;Do all that is in your heart; for God is with you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:3" id="1_Chronicles-17-3">It happened the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:4" id="1_Chronicles-17-4">&#8220;Go and tell David my servant, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh, &#8220;You shall not build me a house to dwell in;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:5" id="1_Chronicles-17-5">for I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, to this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tent to another.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:6" id="1_Chronicles-17-6">In all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, &#8216;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:7" id="1_Chronicles-17-7">&#8220;Now therefore, you shall tell my servant David, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &#8220;I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:8" id="1_Chronicles-17-8">I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:9" id="1_Chronicles-17-9">I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:10" id="1_Chronicles-17-10">and from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:11" id="1_Chronicles-17-11">It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:12" id="1_Chronicles-17-12">He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:13" id="1_Chronicles-17-13">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:14" id="1_Chronicles-17-14">but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne shall be established forever.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:15" id="1_Chronicles-17-15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:16" id="1_Chronicles-17-16">Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, &#8220;Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:17" id="1_Chronicles-17-17">This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come, and have respected me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:18" id="1_Chronicles-17-18">What can David say yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? For you know your servant.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:19" id="1_Chronicles-17-19">Yahweh, for your servant&#8217;s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make known all these great things.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:20" id="1_Chronicles-17-20">Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:21" id="1_Chronicles-17-21">What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:22" id="1_Chronicles-17-22">For your people Israel you made your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:23" id="1_Chronicles-17-23">Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:24" id="1_Chronicles-17-24">Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, &#8216;Yahweh of Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David your servant is established before you.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:25" id="1_Chronicles-17-25">For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:26" id="1_Chronicles-17-26">Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 17:27" id="1_Chronicles-17-27">Now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.&#8221;</span>
