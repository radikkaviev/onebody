  <h2>1 Chronicles 21</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:1" id="1_Chronicles-21-1">Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:2" id="1_Chronicles-21-2">David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, &#8220;Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:3" id="1_Chronicles-21-3">Joab said, &#8220;May Yahweh make his people a hundred times as many as they are. But, my lord the king, aren&#8217;t they all my lord&#8217;s servants? Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:4" id="1_Chronicles-21-4">Nevertheless the king&#8217;s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:5" id="1_Chronicles-21-5">Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:6" id="1_Chronicles-21-6">But he didn&#8217;t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king&#8217;s word was abominable to Joab.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:7" id="1_Chronicles-21-7">God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:8" id="1_Chronicles-21-8">David said to God, &#8220;I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:9" id="1_Chronicles-21-9">Yahweh spoke to Gad, David&#8217;s seer, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:10" id="1_Chronicles-21-10">&#8220;Go and speak to David, saying, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh, &#8220;I offer you three things. Choose one of them, that I may do it to you.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:11" id="1_Chronicles-21-11">So Gad came to David, and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Yahweh, &#8216;Take your choice:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:12" id="1_Chronicles-21-12">either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:13" id="1_Chronicles-21-13">David said to Gad, &#8220;I am in distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for his mercies are very great. Let me not fall into the hand of man.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:14" id="1_Chronicles-21-14">So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:15" id="1_Chronicles-21-15">God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he relented of the disaster, and said to the destroying angel, &#8220;It is enough; now stay your hand.&#8221; The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:16" id="1_Chronicles-21-16">David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:17" id="1_Chronicles-21-17">David said to God, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father&#8217;s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:18" id="1_Chronicles-21-18">Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:19" id="1_Chronicles-21-19">David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:20" id="1_Chronicles-21-20">Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:21" id="1_Chronicles-21-21">As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:22" id="1_Chronicles-21-22">Then David said to Ornan, &#8220;Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh. You shall sell it to me for the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the people.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:23" id="1_Chronicles-21-23">Ornan said to David, &#8220;Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes. Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it all.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:24" id="1_Chronicles-21-24">King David said to Ornan, &#8220;No; but I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt offering without cost.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:25" id="1_Chronicles-21-25">So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:26" id="1_Chronicles-21-26">David built an altar to Yahweh there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:27" id="1_Chronicles-21-27">Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:28" id="1_Chronicles-21-28">At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:29" id="1_Chronicles-21-29">For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Chronicles 21:30" id="1_Chronicles-21-30">But David couldn&#8217;t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</span>
