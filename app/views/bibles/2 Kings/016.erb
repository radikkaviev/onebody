  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:2" id="2_Kings-16-2">Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign; and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: and he didn&#8217;t do that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh his God, like David his father.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:3" id="2_Kings-16-3">But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yes, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the nations, whom Yahweh cast out from before the children of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:4" id="2_Kings-16-4">He sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:5" id="2_Kings-16-5">Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:6" id="2_Kings-16-6">At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath, and lived there, to this day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:7" id="2_Kings-16-7">So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, &#8220;I am your servant and your son. Come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who rise up against me.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:8" id="2_Kings-16-8">Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king&#8217;s house, and sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:9" id="2_Kings-16-9">The king of Assyria listened to him; and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried its people captive to Kir, and killed Rezin.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:10" id="2_Kings-16-10">King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and its pattern, according to all its workmanship.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:11" id="2_Kings-16-11">Urijah the priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Urijah the priest made it for the coming of king Ahaz from Damascus.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:12" id="2_Kings-16-12">When the king had come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king drew near to the altar, and offered on it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:13" id="2_Kings-16-13">He burnt his burnt offering and his meal offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, on the altar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:14" id="2_Kings-16-14">The bronze altar, which was before Yahweh, he brought from the forefront of the house, from between his altar and the house of Yahweh, and put it on the north side of his altar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:15" id="2_Kings-16-15">King Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, &#8220;On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meal offering, and the king&#8217;s burnt offering, and his meal offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meal offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice; but the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:16" id="2_Kings-16-16">Urijah the priest did so, according to all that king Ahaz commanded.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:17" id="2_Kings-16-17">King Ahaz cut off the panels of the bases, and removed the basin from off them, and took down the sea from off the bronze oxen that were under it, and put it on a pavement of stone.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:18" id="2_Kings-16-18">The covered way for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king&#8217;s entry outside, turned he to the house of Yahweh, because of the king of Assyria.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 16:19" id="2_Kings-16-19">Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, aren&#8217;t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span>
