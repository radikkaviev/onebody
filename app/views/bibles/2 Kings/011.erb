  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 11:12" id="2_Kings-11-12">Then he brought out the king&#8217;s son, and put the crown on him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Kings 11:13" id="2_Kings-11-13">When Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the house of Yahweh:</span>
