  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 32:25" id="Deuteronomy-32-25">Outside the sword shall bereave,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and in the rooms, terror;<br/>   on both young man and virgin,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The nursing infant with the gray-haired man.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 32:26" id="Deuteronomy-32-26">I said, I would scatter them afar.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I would make their memory to cease from among men;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 32:27" id="Deuteronomy-32-27">were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lest their adversaries should judge wrongly,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lest they should say, &#8216;Our hand is exalted,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Yahweh has not done all this.&#8217;&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Deuteronomy 32:46" id="Deuteronomy-32-46">He said to them, &#8220;Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</span>
