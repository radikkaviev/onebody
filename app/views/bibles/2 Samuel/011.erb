  <h2>2 Samuel 11</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:1" id="2_Samuel-11-1">It happened, at the return of the year, at the time when kings go out, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed at Jerusalem.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:2" id="2_Samuel-11-2">It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king&#8217;s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:3" id="2_Samuel-11-3">David sent and inquired after the woman. One said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:4" id="2_Samuel-11-4">David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:5" id="2_Samuel-11-5">The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, &#8220;I am with child.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:6" id="2_Samuel-11-6">David sent to Joab, &#8220;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&#8221; Joab sent Uriah to David.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:7" id="2_Samuel-11-7">When Uriah had come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:8" id="2_Samuel-11-8">David said to Uriah, &#8220;Go down to your house, and wash your feet.&#8221; Uriah departed out of the king&#8217;s house, and a gift from the king was sent after him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:9" id="2_Samuel-11-9">But Uriah slept at the door of the king&#8217;s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn&#8217;t go down to his house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:10" id="2_Samuel-11-10">When they had told David, saying, &#8220;Uriah didn&#8217;t go down to his house,&#8221; David said to Uriah, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you come from a journey? Why didn&#8217;t you go down to your house?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:11" id="2_Samuel-11-11">Uriah said to David, &#8220;The ark, Israel, and Judah, are staying in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field. Shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:12" id="2_Samuel-11-12">David said to Uriah, &#8220;Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart.&#8221; So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:13" id="2_Samuel-11-13">When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk. At evening, he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn&#8217;t go down to his house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:14" id="2_Samuel-11-14">It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:15" id="2_Samuel-11-15">He wrote in the letter, saying, &#8220;Send Uriah to the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck, and die.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:16" id="2_Samuel-11-16">It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:17" id="2_Samuel-11-17">The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab. Some of the people fell, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:18" id="2_Samuel-11-18">Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:19" id="2_Samuel-11-19">and he commanded the messenger, saying, &#8220;When you have finished telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:20" id="2_Samuel-11-20">it shall be that, if the king&#8217;s wrath arise, and he asks you, &#8216;Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn&#8217;t you know that they would shoot from the wall?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:21" id="2_Samuel-11-21">who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn&#8217;t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?&#8217; then you shall say, &#8216;Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:22" id="2_Samuel-11-22">So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:23" id="2_Samuel-11-23">The messenger said to David, &#8220;The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:24" id="2_Samuel-11-24">The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king&#8217;s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:25" id="2_Samuel-11-25">Then David said to the messenger, &#8220;Thus you shall tell Joab, &#8216;Don&#8217;t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another. Make your battle stronger against the city, and overthrow it.&#8217; Encourage him.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:26" id="2_Samuel-11-26">When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 11:27" id="2_Samuel-11-27">When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.</span>
