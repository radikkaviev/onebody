  <h2>2 Samuel 19</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:1" id="2_Samuel-19-1">It was told Joab, &#8220;Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:2" id="2_Samuel-19-2">The victory that day was turned into mourning to all the people; for the people heard it said that day, &#8220;The king grieves for his son.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:3" id="2_Samuel-19-3">The people sneaked into the city that day, as people who are ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:4" id="2_Samuel-19-4">The king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, &#8220;My son Absalom, Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:5" id="2_Samuel-19-5">Joab came into the house to the king, and said, &#8220;You have shamed this day the faces of all your servants, who this day have saved your life, and the lives of your sons and of your daughters, and the lives of your wives, and the lives of your concubines;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:6" id="2_Samuel-19-6">in that you love those who hate you, and hate those who love you. For you have declared this day, that princes and servants are nothing to you. For today I perceive that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it would have pleased you well.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:7" id="2_Samuel-19-7">Now therefore arise, go out, and speak to comfort your servants; for I swear by Yahweh, if you don&#8217;t go out, not a man will stay with you this night. That would be worse to you than all the evil that has happened to you from your youth until now.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:8" id="2_Samuel-19-8">Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. They told to all the people, saying, &#8220;Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.&#8221; All the people came before the king. Now Israel had fled every man to his tent.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:9" id="2_Samuel-19-9">All the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, &#8220;The king delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, and he saved us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:10" id="2_Samuel-19-10">Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why don&#8217;t you speak a word of bringing the king back?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:11" id="2_Samuel-19-11">King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, &#8220;Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, &#8216;Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house? Since the speech of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:12" id="2_Samuel-19-12">You are my brothers, you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:13" id="2_Samuel-19-13">Say to Amasa, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you my bone and my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if you aren&#8217;t captain of the army before me continually in the room of Joab.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:14" id="2_Samuel-19-14">He bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as one man; so that they sent to the king, saying, &#8220;Return, you and all your servants.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:15" id="2_Samuel-19-15">So the king returned, and came to the Jordan. Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to bring the king over the Jordan.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:16" id="2_Samuel-19-16">Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, who was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:17" id="2_Samuel-19-17">There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went through the Jordan in the presence of the king.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:18" id="2_Samuel-19-18">A ferry boat went to bring over the king&#8217;s household, and to do what he thought good. Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, when he had come over the Jordan.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:19" id="2_Samuel-19-19">He said to the king, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let my lord impute iniquity to me, nor remember that which your servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:20" id="2_Samuel-19-20">For your servant knows that I have sinned. Therefore, behold, I have come this day the first of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:21" id="2_Samuel-19-21">But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered, &#8220;Shall Shimei not be put to death for this, because he cursed Yahweh&#8217;s anointed?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:22" id="2_Samuel-19-22">David said, &#8220;What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should this day be adversaries to me? Shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? For don&#8217;t I know that I am this day king over Israel?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:23" id="2_Samuel-19-23">The king said to Shimei, &#8220;You shall not die.&#8221; The king swore to him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:24" id="2_Samuel-19-24">Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither groomed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came home in peace.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:25" id="2_Samuel-19-25">It happened, when he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said to him, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go with me, Mephibosheth?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:26" id="2_Samuel-19-26">He answered, &#8220;My lord, O king, my servant deceived me. For your servant said, I will saddle me a donkey, that I may ride thereon, and go with the king; because your servant is lame.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:27" id="2_Samuel-19-27">He has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God. Do therefore what is good in your eyes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:28" id="2_Samuel-19-28">For all my father&#8217;s house were but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. What right therefore have I yet that I should cry any more to the king?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:29" id="2_Samuel-19-29">The king said to him, &#8220;Why do you speak any more of your matters? I say, you and Ziba divide the land.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:30" id="2_Samuel-19-30">Mephibosheth said to the king, &#8220;Yes, let him take all, because my lord the king has come in peace to his own house.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:31" id="2_Samuel-19-31">Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim; and he went over the Jordan with the king, to conduct him over the Jordan.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:32" id="2_Samuel-19-32">Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even eighty years old: and he had provided the king with sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:33" id="2_Samuel-19-33">The king said to Barzillai, &#8220;Come over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:34" id="2_Samuel-19-34">Barzillai said to the king, &#8220;How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:35" id="2_Samuel-19-35">I am this day eighty years old. Can I discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should your servant be yet a burden to my lord the king?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:36" id="2_Samuel-19-36">Your servant would but just go over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king repay me with such a reward?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:37" id="2_Samuel-19-37">Please let your servant turn back again, that I may die in my own city, by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold, your servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good to you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:38" id="2_Samuel-19-38">The king answered, &#8220;Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good to you. Whatever you require of me, that I will do for you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:39" id="2_Samuel-19-39">All the people went over the Jordan, and the king went over. Then the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned to his own place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:40" id="2_Samuel-19-40">So the king went over to Gilgal, and Chimham went over with him. All the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half the people of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:41" id="2_Samuel-19-41">Behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said to the king, &#8220;Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away, and brought the king, and his household, over the Jordan, and all David&#8217;s men with him?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:42" id="2_Samuel-19-42">All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, &#8220;Because the king is a close relative to us. Why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king&#8217;s cost? Or has he given us any gift?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 19:43" id="2_Samuel-19-43">The men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, &#8220;We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more claim to David than you. Why then did you despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king?&#8221; The words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.</span>
