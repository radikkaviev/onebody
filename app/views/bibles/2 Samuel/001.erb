  <h2>2 Samuel 1</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:1" id="2_Samuel-1-1">It happened after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:2" id="2_Samuel-1-2">it happened on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes torn, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and showed respect.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:3" id="2_Samuel-1-3">David said to him, &#8220;Where do you come from?&#8221; He said to him, &#8220;I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:4" id="2_Samuel-1-4">David said to him, &#8220;How did it go? Please tell me.&#8221; He answered, &#8220;The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:5" id="2_Samuel-1-5">David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:6" id="2_Samuel-1-6">The young man who told him said, &#8220;As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:7" id="2_Samuel-1-7">When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:8" id="2_Samuel-1-8">He said to me, &#8216;Who are you?&#8217; I answered him, &#8216;I am an Amalekite.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:9" id="2_Samuel-1-9">He said to me, &#8216;Please stand beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:10" id="2_Samuel-1-10">So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he had fallen. I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:11" id="2_Samuel-1-11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:12" id="2_Samuel-1-12">They mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:13" id="2_Samuel-1-13">David said to the young man who told him, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:14" id="2_Samuel-1-14">David said to him, &#8220;How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh&#8217;s anointed?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:15" id="2_Samuel-1-15">David called one of the young men, and said, &#8220;Go near, and fall on him.&#8221; He struck him, so that he died.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:16" id="2_Samuel-1-16">David said to him, &#8220;Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I have slain Yahweh&#8217;s anointed.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:17" id="2_Samuel-1-17">David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:18" id="2_Samuel-1-18">(and he commanded them to teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:19" id="2_Samuel-1-19">&#8220;Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How the mighty have fallen!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:20" id="2_Samuel-1-20">Don&#8217;t tell it in Gath.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Don&#8217;t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon,<br/>   lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:21" id="2_Samuel-1-21">You mountains of Gilboa,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:22" id="2_Samuel-1-22">From the blood of the slain,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>from the fat of the mighty,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jonathan&#8217;s bow didn&#8217;t turn back.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Saul&#8217;s sword didn&#8217;t return empty.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:23" id="2_Samuel-1-23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In their death, they were not divided.<br/>   They were swifter than eagles.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They were stronger than lions.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:24" id="2_Samuel-1-24">You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who clothed you in scarlet delicately,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:25" id="2_Samuel-1-25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Jonathan is slain on your high places.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:26" id="2_Samuel-1-26">I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You have been very pleasant to me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your love to me was wonderful,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>passing the love of women.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 1:27" id="2_Samuel-1-27">How are the mighty fallen,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the weapons of war perished!&#8221;<br/></span>
