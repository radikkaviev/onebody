  <h2>2 Samuel 13</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:1" id="2_Samuel-13-1">It happened after this, that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:2" id="2_Samuel-13-2">Amnon was so troubled that he fell sick because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin; and it seemed hard to Amnon to do anything to her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:3" id="2_Samuel-13-3">But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:4" id="2_Samuel-13-4">He said to him, &#8220;Why, son of the king, are you so sad from day to day? Won&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221; Amnon said to him, &#8220;I love Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:5" id="2_Samuel-13-5">Jonadab said to him, &#8220;Lay down on your bed, and pretend to be sick. When your father comes to see you, tell him, &#8216;Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:6" id="2_Samuel-13-6">So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &#8220;Please let my sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:7" id="2_Samuel-13-7">Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, &#8220;Go now to your brother Amnon&#8217;s house, and prepare food for him.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:8" id="2_Samuel-13-8">So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&#8217;s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:9" id="2_Samuel-13-9">She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, &#8220;Have all men leave me.&#8221; Every man went out from him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:10" id="2_Samuel-13-10">Amnon said to Tamar, &#8220;Bring the food into the room, that I may eat from your hand.&#8221; Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the room to Amnon her brother.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:11" id="2_Samuel-13-11">When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, &#8220;Come, lie with me, my sister!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:12" id="2_Samuel-13-12">She answered him, &#8220;No, my brother, do not force me! For no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don&#8217;t you do this folly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:13" id="2_Samuel-13-13">I, where would I carry my shame? And as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:14" id="2_Samuel-13-14">However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:15" id="2_Samuel-13-15">Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, &#8220;Arise, be gone!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:16" id="2_Samuel-13-16">She said to him, &#8220;Not so, because this great wrong in sending me away is worse than the other that you did to me!&#8221; But he would not listen to her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:17" id="2_Samuel-13-17">Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, &#8220;Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:18" id="2_Samuel-13-18">She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king&#8217;s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:19" id="2_Samuel-13-19">Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:20" id="2_Samuel-13-20">Absalom her brother said to her, &#8220;Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now hold your peace, my sister. He is your brother. Don&#8217;t take this thing to heart.&#8221; So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom&#8217;s house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:21" id="2_Samuel-13-21">But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:22" id="2_Samuel-13-22">Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:23" id="2_Samuel-13-23">It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal Hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king&#8217;s sons.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:24" id="2_Samuel-13-24">Absalom came to the king, and said, &#8220;See now, your servant has sheepshearers. Please let the king and his servants go with your servant.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:25" id="2_Samuel-13-25">The king said to Absalom, &#8220;No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you.&#8221; He pressed him; however he would not go, but blessed him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:26" id="2_Samuel-13-26">Then Absalom said, &#8220;If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us.&#8221; The king said to him, &#8220;Why should he go with you?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:27" id="2_Samuel-13-27">But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king&#8217;s sons go with him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:28" id="2_Samuel-13-28">Absalom commanded his servants, saying, &#8220;Mark now, when Amnon&#8217;s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, &#8216;Strike Amnon,&#8217; then kill him. Don&#8217;t be afraid. Haven&#8217;t I commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:29" id="2_Samuel-13-29">The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&#8217;s sons arose, and every man got up on his mule, and fled.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:30" id="2_Samuel-13-30">It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, &#8220;Absalom has slain all the king&#8217;s sons, and there is not one of them left!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:31" id="2_Samuel-13-31">Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:32" id="2_Samuel-13-32">Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David&#8217;s brother, answered, &#8220;Don&#8217;t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king&#8217;s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:33" id="2_Samuel-13-33">Now therefore don&#8217;t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king&#8217;s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:34" id="2_Samuel-13-34">But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming by way of the hillside behind him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:35" id="2_Samuel-13-35">Jonadab said to the king, &#8220;Behold, the king&#8217;s sons are coming! It is as your servant said.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:36" id="2_Samuel-13-36">It happened, as soon as he had finished speaking, that behold, the king&#8217;s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept. The king also and all his servants wept bitterly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:37" id="2_Samuel-13-37">But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. David mourned for his son every day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:38" id="2_Samuel-13-38">So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 13:39" id="2_Samuel-13-39">King David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, since he was dead.</span>
