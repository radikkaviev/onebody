  <h2>2 Samuel 7</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:1" id="2_Samuel-7-1">It happened, when the king lived in his house, and Yahweh had given him rest from all his enemies all around,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:2" id="2_Samuel-7-2">that the king said to Nathan the prophet, &#8220;See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:3" id="2_Samuel-7-3">Nathan said to the king, &#8220;Go, do all that is in your heart; for Yahweh is with you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:4" id="2_Samuel-7-4">It happened the same night, that the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:5" id="2_Samuel-7-5">&#8220;Go and tell my servant David, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh, &#8220;Shall you build me a house for me to dwell in?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:6" id="2_Samuel-7-6">For I have not lived in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have moved around in a tent and in a tabernacle.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:7" id="2_Samuel-7-7">In all places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel, did I say a word to any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, &#8216;Why have you not built me a house of cedar?&#8217;&#8221;&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:8" id="2_Samuel-7-8">Now therefore you shall tell my servant David this, &#8216;Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &#8220;I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over my people, over Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:9" id="2_Samuel-7-9">I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies from before you. I will make you a great name, like the name of the great ones who are in the earth.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:10" id="2_Samuel-7-10">I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:11" id="2_Samuel-7-11">and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I will cause you to rest from all your enemies. Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:12" id="2_Samuel-7-12">When your days are fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:13" id="2_Samuel-7-13">He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:14" id="2_Samuel-7-14">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:15" id="2_Samuel-7-15">but my loving kindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:16" id="2_Samuel-7-16">Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:17" id="2_Samuel-7-17">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:18" id="2_Samuel-7-18">Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, &#8220;Who am I, Lord Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:19" id="2_Samuel-7-19">This was yet a small thing in your eyes, Lord Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your servant&#8217;s house for a great while to come; and this after the way of men, Lord Yahweh!</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:20" id="2_Samuel-7-20">What more can David say to you? For you know your servant, Lord Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:21" id="2_Samuel-7-21">For your word&#8217;s sake, and according to your own heart, you have worked all this greatness, to make your servant know it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:22" id="2_Samuel-7-22">Therefore you are great, Yahweh God. For there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:23" id="2_Samuel-7-23">What one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, and to make himself a name, and to do great things for you, and awesome things for your land, before your people, whom you redeem to yourself out of Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:24" id="2_Samuel-7-24">You established for yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:25" id="2_Samuel-7-25">Now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:26" id="2_Samuel-7-26">Let your name be magnified forever, saying, &#8216;Yahweh of Armies is God over Israel; and the house of your servant David shall be established before you.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:27" id="2_Samuel-7-27">For you, Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, &#8216;I will build you a house.&#8217; Therefore your servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:28" id="2_Samuel-7-28">&#8220;Now, O Lord Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="2 Samuel 7:29" id="2_Samuel-7-29">Now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you; for you, Lord Yahweh, have spoken it. Let the house of your servant be blessed forever with your blessing.&#8221;</span>
