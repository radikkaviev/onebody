  <h2>Ruth 2</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:1" id="Ruth-2-1">Naomi had a kinsman of her husband&#8217;s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:2" id="Ruth-2-2">Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, &#8220;Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.&#8221; She said to her, &#8220;Go, my daughter.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:3" id="Ruth-2-3">She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:4" id="Ruth-2-4">Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, &#8220;Yahweh be with you.&#8221; They answered him, &#8220;Yahweh bless you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:5" id="Ruth-2-5">Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, &#8220;Whose young lady is this?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:6" id="Ruth-2-6">The servant who was set over the reapers answered, &#8220;It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:7" id="Ruth-2-7">She said, &#8216;Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.&#8217; So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:8" id="Ruth-2-8">Then Boaz said to Ruth, &#8220;Listen, my daughter. Don&#8217;t go to glean in another field, and don&#8217;t go from here, but stay here close to my maidens.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:9" id="Ruth-2-9">Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them. Haven&#8217;t I commanded the young men not to touch you? When you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink from that which the young men have drawn.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:10" id="Ruth-2-10">Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, &#8220;Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, since I am a foreigner?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:11" id="Ruth-2-11">Boaz answered her, &#8220;It has fully been shown me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn&#8217;t know before.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:12" id="Ruth-2-12">May Yahweh repay your work, and a full reward be given you from Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:13" id="Ruth-2-13">Then she said, &#8220;Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:14" id="Ruth-2-14">At meal time Boaz said to her, &#8220;Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar.&#8221; She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left some of it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:15" id="Ruth-2-15">When she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, &#8220;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don&#8217;t reproach her.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:16" id="Ruth-2-16">Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don&#8217;t rebuke her.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:17" id="Ruth-2-17">So she gleaned in the field until evening; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:18" id="Ruth-2-18">She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought out and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:19" id="Ruth-2-19">Her mother-in-law said to her, &#8220;Where have you gleaned today? Where have you worked? Blessed be he who noticed you.&#8221; She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, &#8220;The man&#8217;s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:20" id="Ruth-2-20">Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &#8220;Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.&#8221; Naomi said to her, &#8220;The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:21" id="Ruth-2-21">Ruth the Moabitess said, &#8220;Yes, he said to me, &#8216;You shall stay close to my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:22" id="Ruth-2-22">Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, &#8220;It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ruth 2:23" id="Ruth-2-23">So she stayed close to the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</span>
