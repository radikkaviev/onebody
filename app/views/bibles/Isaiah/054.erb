  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:1" id="Isaiah-54-1">&#8220;Sing, barren, you who didn&#8217;t bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:2" id="Isaiah-54-2">&#8220;Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of your habitations; don&#8217;t spare: lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:3" id="Isaiah-54-3">For you shall spread out on the right hand and on the left; and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:4" id="Isaiah-54-4">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed: neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed: for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach of your widowhood you shall remember no more.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:5" id="Isaiah-54-5">For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:6" id="Isaiah-54-6">For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,&#8221; says your God.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:7" id="Isaiah-54-7">&#8220;For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies will I gather you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:8" id="Isaiah-54-8">In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment; but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you,&#8221; says Yahweh your Redeemer.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:9" id="Isaiah-54-9">&#8220;For this is like the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you, nor rebuke you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:10" id="Isaiah-54-10">For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving kindness shall not depart from you, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed,&#8221; says Yahweh who has mercy on you.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:11" id="Isaiah-54-11">&#8220;You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold, I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your foundations with sapphires.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:13" id="Isaiah-54-13">All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall be the peace of your children.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:14" id="Isaiah-54-14">In righteousness you shall be established: you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror, for it shall not come near you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:15" id="Isaiah-54-15">Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whoever shall gather together against you shall fall because of you.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:16" id="Isaiah-54-16">&#8220;Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 54:17" id="Isaiah-54-17">No weapon that is formed against you will prevail;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you will condemn every tongue that rises against you in judgment.<br/>   This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their righteousness which is of me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/>   <br/></span>
