  <h2>Isaiah 40</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:1" id="Isaiah-40-1">&#8220;Comfort, comfort my people,&#8221; says your God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:2" id="Isaiah-40-2">&#8220;Speak comfortably to Jerusalem; and call out to her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she has received of Yahweh&#8217;s hand double for all her sins.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:3" id="Isaiah-40-3">The voice of one who calls out,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Prepare the way of Yahweh in the wilderness!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make a level highway in the desert for our God.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:4" id="Isaiah-40-4">Every valley shall be exalted,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and every mountain and hill shall be made low.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The uneven shall be made level,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the rough places a plain.<br/></span>

Don&#8217;t be afraid.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Say to the cities of Judah, &#8220;Behold, your God!&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:10" id="Isaiah-40-10">Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his arm will rule for him.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, his reward is with him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his recompense before him.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:11" id="Isaiah-40-11">He will feed his flock like a shepherd.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will gather the lambs in his arm,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and carry them in his bosom.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will gently lead those who have their young.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:12" id="Isaiah-40-12">Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and marked off the sky with his span,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and calculated the dust of the earth in a measure,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and weighed the mountains in scales,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the hills in a balance?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:13" id="Isaiah-40-13">Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>or has taught him as his counselor?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:14" id="Isaiah-40-14">Who did he take counsel with,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and who instructed him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and taught him in the path of justice,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and taught him knowledge,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and showed him the way of understanding?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:15" id="Isaiah-40-15">Behold, the nations are like a drop in a bucket,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and are regarded as a speck of dust on a balance.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, he lifts up the islands like a very little thing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:16" id="Isaiah-40-16">Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor its animals sufficient for a burnt offering.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:20" id="Isaiah-40-20">He who is too impoverished for such an offering chooses a tree that will not rot.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He seeks a skillful workman to set up an engraved image for him that will not be moved.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:21" id="Isaiah-40-21">Haven&#8217;t you known?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Haven&#8217;t you heard, yet?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Haven&#8217;t you been told from the beginning?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Haven&#8217;t you understood from the foundations of the earth?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:22" id="Isaiah-40-22">It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and spreads them out like a tent to dwell in;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 40:27" id="Isaiah-40-27">Why do you say, Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and speak, Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;My way is hidden from Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the justice due me is disregarded by my God?&#8221;<br/></span>
