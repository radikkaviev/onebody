  <h2>Isaiah 58</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:1" id="Isaiah-58-1">&#8220;Cry aloud, don&#8217;t spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet, and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house of Jacob their sins.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:2" id="Isaiah-58-2">Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and didn&#8217;t forsake the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:3" id="Isaiah-58-3">&#8216;Why have we fasted,&#8217; say they, &#8216;and you don&#8217;t see? Why have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?&#8217;<br/>   <br/>   &#8220;Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:4" id="Isaiah-58-4">Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you don&#8217;t fast this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:5" id="Isaiah-58-5">Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:6" id="Isaiah-58-6">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the fast that I have chosen: to release the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:7" id="Isaiah-58-7">Isn&#8217;t it to distribute your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from your own flesh?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:8" id="Isaiah-58-8">Then your light shall break forth as the morning, and your healing shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:9" id="Isaiah-58-9">Then you shall call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry, and he will say, &#8216;Here I am.&#8217;<br/>   <br/>   &#8220;If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:10" id="Isaiah-58-10">and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light shall rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:11" id="Isaiah-58-11">and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters don&#8217;t fail.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:12" id="Isaiah-58-12">Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places; you shall raise up the foundations of many generations; and you shall be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:13" id="Isaiah-58-13">&#8220;If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, and the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 58:14" id="Isaiah-58-14">then you shall delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:&#8221;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.<br/>   <br/></span>
