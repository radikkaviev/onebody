  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:5" id="Isaiah-36-5">I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words. Now in whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:6" id="Isaiah-36-6">Behold, you trust in the staff of this bruised reed, even in Egypt, which if a man leans on it, it will go into his hand and pierce it. So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:12" id="Isaiah-36-12">But Rabshakeh said, &#8220;Has my master sent me only to your master and to you, to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:13" id="Isaiah-36-13">Then Rabshakeh stood, and called out with a loud voice in the Jews&#8217; language, and said, &#8220;Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:16" id="Isaiah-36-16">Don&#8217;t listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria, &#8216;Make your peace with me, and come out to me; and each of you eat from his vine, and each one from his fig tree, and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:17" id="Isaiah-36-17">until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 36:18" id="Isaiah-36-18">Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, &#8220;Yahweh will deliver us.&#8221; Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?</span>
