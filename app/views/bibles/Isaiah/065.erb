  <h2>Isaiah 65</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:1" id="Isaiah-65-1">&#8220;I am inquired of by those who didn&#8217;t ask; I am found by those who didn&#8217;t seek me: I said, See me, see me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:2" id="Isaiah-65-2">I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:3" id="Isaiah-65-3">a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:4" id="Isaiah-65-4">who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig&#8217;s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:5" id="Isaiah-65-5">who say, Stand by yourself, don&#8217;t come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:6" id="Isaiah-65-6">&#8220;Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:7" id="Isaiah-65-7">your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,&#8221; says Yahweh, &#8220;who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:8" id="Isaiah-65-8">Thus says Yahweh,<br/>   &#8220;As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, &#8216;Don&#8217;t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:&#8217; so will I do for my servants&#8217; sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:9" id="Isaiah-65-9">I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:10" id="Isaiah-65-10">Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:11" id="Isaiah-65-11">&#8220;But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:12" id="Isaiah-65-12">I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn&#8217;t answer; when I spoke, you didn&#8217;t listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn&#8217;t delight.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:13" id="Isaiah-65-13">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, &#8220;Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:14" id="Isaiah-65-14">behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:15" id="Isaiah-65-15">You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants by another name:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:16" id="Isaiah-65-16">so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:17" id="Isaiah-65-17">&#8220;For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:18" id="Isaiah-65-18">But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:19" id="Isaiah-65-19">I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:20" id="Isaiah-65-20">&#8220;There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:21" id="Isaiah-65-21">They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:22" id="Isaiah-65-22">They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:23" id="Isaiah-65-23">They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:24" id="Isaiah-65-24">It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 65:25" id="Isaiah-65-25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent&#8217;s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/>   <br/></span>
