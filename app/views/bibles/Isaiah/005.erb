  <h2>Isaiah 5</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:1" id="Isaiah-5-1">Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:2" id="Isaiah-5-2">He dug it up,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>gathered out its stones,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>planted it with the choicest vine,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>built a tower in its midst,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and also cut out a winepress therein.<br/>   He looked for it to yield grapes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but it yielded wild grapes.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:3" id="Isaiah-5-3">&#8220;Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>please judge between me and my vineyard.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:4" id="Isaiah-5-4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:5" id="Isaiah-5-5">Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:6" id="Isaiah-5-6">I will lay it a wasteland.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It won&#8217;t be pruned nor hoed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but it will grow briers and thorns.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:7" id="Isaiah-5-7">For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the men of Judah his pleasant plant:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:8" id="Isaiah-5-8">Woe to those who join house to house,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who lay field to field, until there is no room,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:9" id="Isaiah-5-9">In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: &#8220;Surely many houses will be desolate,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even great and beautiful, unoccupied.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:10" id="Isaiah-5-10">For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:11" id="Isaiah-5-11">Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:12" id="Isaiah-5-12">The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they don&#8217;t respect the work of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither have they considered the operation of his hands.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:13" id="Isaiah-5-13">Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Their honorable men are famished,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their multitudes are parched with thirst.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:14" id="Isaiah-5-14">Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and opened its mouth without measure;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:15" id="Isaiah-5-15">So man is brought low,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>mankind is humbled,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:16" id="Isaiah-5-16">but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:17" id="Isaiah-5-17">Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:18" id="Isaiah-5-18">Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and wickedness as with cart rope;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:19" id="Isaiah-5-19">Who say, &#8220;Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that we may know it!&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:20" id="Isaiah-5-20">Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who put darkness for light,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and light for darkness;<br/>   who put bitter for sweet,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and sweet for bitter!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:21" id="Isaiah-5-21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and prudent in their own sight!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:22" id="Isaiah-5-22">Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and champions at mixing strong drink;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:23" id="Isaiah-5-23">who acquit the guilty for a bribe,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but deny justice for the innocent!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:24" id="Isaiah-5-24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so their root shall be as rottenness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their blossom shall go up as dust;<br/>   because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:25" id="Isaiah-5-25">Therefore Yahweh&#8217;s anger burns against his people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them.<br/>   The mountains tremble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets.<br/>   For all this, his anger is not turned away,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but his hand is still stretched out.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:26" id="Isaiah-5-26">He will lift up a banner to the nations from far,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 5:27" id="Isaiah-5-27">None shall be weary nor stumble among them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>none shall slumber nor sleep;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither shall the belt of their waist be untied,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:<br/></span>
