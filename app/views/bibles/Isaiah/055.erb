  <h2>Isaiah 55</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:1" id="Isaiah-55-1">&#8220;Come, everyone who thirsts, to the waters! Come, he who has no money, buy, and eat! Yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:2" id="Isaiah-55-2">Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which doesn&#8217;t satisfy? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:3" id="Isaiah-55-3">Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live: and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:4" id="Isaiah-55-4">Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and commander to the peoples.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:5" id="Isaiah-55-5">Behold, you shall call a nation that you don&#8217;t know; and a nation that didn&#8217;t know you shall run to you, because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:6" id="Isaiah-55-6">Seek Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while he is near:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:7" id="Isaiah-55-7">let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:8" id="Isaiah-55-8">&#8220;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:9" id="Isaiah-55-9">&#8220;For as the heavens are higher than the earth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so are my ways higher than your ways,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and my thoughts than your thoughts.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:10" id="Isaiah-55-10">For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and doesn&#8217;t return there, but waters the earth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and makes it bring forth and bud,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:11" id="Isaiah-55-11">so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>it shall not return to me void,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but it shall accomplish that which I please,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it shall prosper in the thing I sent it to do.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:12" id="Isaiah-55-12">For you shall go out with joy,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall clap their hands.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 55:13" id="Isaiah-55-13">Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree; and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
