  <h2>Isaiah 31</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:1" id="Isaiah-31-1">Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rely on horses,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and trust in chariots because they are many,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and in horsemen because they are very strong,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they don&#8217;t look to the Holy One of Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they don&#8217;t seek Yahweh!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:2" id="Isaiah-31-2">Yet he also is wise, and will bring disaster,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evildoers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and against the help of those who work iniquity.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:3" id="Isaiah-31-3">Now the Egyptians are men, and not God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and their horses flesh, and not spirit.<br/>   When Yahweh stretches out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he who is helped shall fall,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they all shall be consumed together.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:4" id="Isaiah-31-4">For thus says Yahweh to me,<br/>   &#8220;As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>will not be dismayed at their voice,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor abase himself for their noise,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:5" id="Isaiah-31-5">As birds hovering, so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will protect and deliver it.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He will pass over and preserve it.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:6" id="Isaiah-31-6"><br/>  Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted, children of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:7" id="Isaiah-31-7">For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of goldâ€”sin which your own hands have made for you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:8" id="Isaiah-31-8">&#8220;The Assyrian will fall by the sword, not of man;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the sword, not of mankind, shall devour him.<br/>   He will flee from the sword,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his young men will become subject to forced labor.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 31:9" id="Isaiah-31-9">His rock will pass away by reason of terror,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his princes will be afraid of the banner,&#8221;<br/>   says Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his furnace in Jerusalem.<br/></span>
