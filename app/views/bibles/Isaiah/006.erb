  <h2>Isaiah 6</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:1" id="Isaiah-6-1">In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:2" id="Isaiah-6-2">Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:3" id="Isaiah-6-3">One called to another, and said,  &#8220;Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The whole earth is full of his glory!&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:4" id="Isaiah-6-4">The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:5" id="Isaiah-6-5">Then I said, &#8220;Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:6" id="Isaiah-6-6">Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:7" id="Isaiah-6-7">He touched my mouth with it, and said, &#8220;Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:8" id="Isaiah-6-8">I heard the Lord&#8217;s voice, saying, &#8220;Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?&#8221; Then I said, &#8220;Here I am. Send me!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:9" id="Isaiah-6-9">He said, &#8220;Go, and tell this people,  &#8216;You hear indeed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but don&#8217;t understand;<br/>   and you see indeed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but don&#8217;t perceive.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:10" id="Isaiah-6-10">Make the heart of this people fat.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes;<br/>   lest they see with their eyes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and hear with their ears,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and understand with their heart,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and turn again, and be healed.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:11" id="Isaiah-6-11">Then I said, &#8220;Lord, how long?&#8221; He answered,  &#8220;Until cities are waste without inhabitant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and houses without man,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the land becomes utterly waste,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:12" id="Isaiah-6-12">And Yahweh has removed men far away,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 6:13" id="Isaiah-6-13">If there is a tenth left in it,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that also will in turn be consumed:<br/>   as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so the holy seed is its stock.&#8221;<br/></span>
