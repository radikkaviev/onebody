  <h2>Isaiah 53</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:1" id="Isaiah-53-1">Who has believed our message?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:2" id="Isaiah-53-2">For he grew up before him as a tender plant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as a root out of dry ground.<br/>   He has no good looks or majesty.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:3" id="Isaiah-53-3">He was despised,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rejected by men;<br/>   a man of suffering,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and acquainted with disease.<br/>   He was despised as one from whom men hide their face;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and we didn&#8217;t respect him.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:4" id="Isaiah-53-4">Surely he has borne our sickness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and carried our suffering;<br/>   yet we considered him plagued,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>struck by God, and afflicted.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:5" id="Isaiah-53-5">But he was pierced for our transgressions.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He was crushed for our iniquities.<br/>   The punishment that brought our peace was on him;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and by his wounds we are healed.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:6" id="Isaiah-53-6">All we like sheep have gone astray.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Everyone has turned to his own way;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:7" id="Isaiah-53-7">He was oppressed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet when he was afflicted he didn&#8217;t open his mouth.<br/>   As a lamb that is led to the slaughter,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so he didn&#8217;t open his mouth.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:8" id="Isaiah-53-8">He was taken away by oppression and judgment;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as for his generation,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and stricken for the disobedience of my people?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:9" id="Isaiah-53-9">They made his grave with the wicked,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and with a rich man in his death;<br/>   although he had done no violence,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither was any deceit in his mouth.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:10" id="Isaiah-53-10">Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He has caused him to suffer.<br/>   When you make his soul an offering for sin,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he shall see his seed.<br/>   He shall prolong his days,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the pleasure of Yahweh shall prosper in his hand.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:11" id="Isaiah-53-11">After the suffering of his soul,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>he will see the light and be satisfied.<br/>   My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will bear their iniquities.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 53:12" id="Isaiah-53-12">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he shall divide the spoil with the strong;<br/>   because he poured out his soul to death,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and was numbered with the transgressors;<br/>   yet he bore the sin of many,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and made intercession for the transgressors.<br/>   <br/></span>
