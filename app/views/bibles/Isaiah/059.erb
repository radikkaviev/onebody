  <h2>Isaiah 59</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:1" id="Isaiah-59-1">Behold, Yahweh&#8217;s hand is not shortened, that it can&#8217;t save; neither his ear heavy, that it can&#8217;t hear:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:2" id="Isaiah-59-2">but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:3" id="Isaiah-59-3">For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:4" id="Isaiah-59-4">None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:5" id="Isaiah-59-5">They hatch adders&#8217; eggs, and weave the spider&#8217;s web: he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:6" id="Isaiah-59-6">Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:7" id="Isaiah-59-7">Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:8" id="Isaiah-59-8">The way of peace they don&#8217;t know; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whoever goes therein does not know peace.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:9" id="Isaiah-59-9">Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:10" id="Isaiah-59-10">We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those who have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among those who are lusty we are as dead men.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:11" id="Isaiah-59-11">We roar all like bears, and moan bitterly like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:12" id="Isaiah-59-12">For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:13" id="Isaiah-59-13">transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:14" id="Isaiah-59-14">Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can&#8217;t enter.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:15" id="Isaiah-59-15">Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:16" id="Isaiah-59-16">He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:17" id="Isaiah-59-17">He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:18" id="Isaiah-59-18">According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:19" id="Isaiah-59-19">So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:20" id="Isaiah-59-20">&#8220;A Redeemer will come to Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to those who turn from disobedience in Jacob,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 59:21" id="Isaiah-59-21">&#8220;As for me, this is my covenant with them,&#8221; says Yahweh. &#8220;My Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed&#8217;s seed,&#8221; says Yahweh, &#8220;from henceforth and forever.&#8221;</span>
