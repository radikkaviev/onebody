  <h2>Isaiah 57</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:1" id="Isaiah-57-1">The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:2" id="Isaiah-57-2">He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:3" id="Isaiah-57-3">&#8220;But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:4" id="Isaiah-57-4">Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth, and stick out your tongue? Aren&#8217;t you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:5" id="Isaiah-57-5">you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:6" id="Isaiah-57-6">Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:7" id="Isaiah-57-7">On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifice.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:8" id="Isaiah-57-8">Behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for you have uncovered to someone besides me,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and have gone up;<br/>   you have enlarged your bed,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and made you a covenant with them:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>you loved their bed where you saw it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:9" id="Isaiah-57-9">You went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:10" id="Isaiah-57-10">You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn&#8217;t say, &#8216;It is in vain.&#8217; You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren&#8217;t faint.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:11" id="Isaiah-57-11">&#8220;Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven&#8217;t I held my peace even of long time, and you don&#8217;t fear me?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:12" id="Isaiah-57-12">I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:13" id="Isaiah-57-13">When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:14" id="Isaiah-57-14">He will say, &#8220;Cast up, cast up, prepare the way,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:15" id="Isaiah-57-15">For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:16" id="Isaiah-57-16">For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:17" id="Isaiah-57-17">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:18" id="Isaiah-57-18">I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:19" id="Isaiah-57-19">I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,&#8221; says Yahweh; &#8220;and I will heal them.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:20" id="Isaiah-57-20">But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can&#8217;t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 57:21" id="Isaiah-57-21">&#8220;There is no peace,&#8221; says my God, &#8220;for the wicked.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
