  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:1" id="Isaiah-47-1">&#8220;Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:2" id="Isaiah-47-2">Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:3" id="Isaiah-47-3">Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:4" id="Isaiah-47-4">Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:5" id="Isaiah-47-5">&#8220;Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans;<br/>   for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:6" id="Isaiah-47-6">I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:7" id="Isaiah-47-7">You said, &#8216;I shall be a mistress forever;&#8217; so that you did not lay these things to your heart, nor did you remember the latter end of it.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:8" id="Isaiah-47-8">&#8220;Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, &#8216;I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:9" id="Isaiah-47-9">but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:10" id="Isaiah-47-10">For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:11" id="Isaiah-47-11">Therefore evil will come on you; you won&#8217;t know when it dawns: and mischief will fall on you; you will not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you don&#8217;t know.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:12" id="Isaiah-47-12">&#8220;Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:13" id="Isaiah-47-13">You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:14" id="Isaiah-47-14">Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Isaiah 47:15" id="Isaiah-47-15">Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.<br/>   <br/></span>
