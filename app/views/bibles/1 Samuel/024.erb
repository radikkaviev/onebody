  <h2>1 Samuel 24</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:1" id="1_Samuel-24-1">It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, &#8220;Behold, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:2" id="1_Samuel-24-2">Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:3" id="1_Samuel-24-3">He came to the sheep pens by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:4" id="1_Samuel-24-4">The men of David said to him, &#8220;Behold, the day of which Yahweh said to you, &#8216;Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.&#8217;&#8221; Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul&#8217;s robe secretly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:5" id="1_Samuel-24-5">It happened afterward, that David&#8217;s heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul&#8217;s skirt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:6" id="1_Samuel-24-6">He said to his men, &#8220;Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh&#8217;s anointed, to put forth my hand against him, since he is Yahweh&#8217;s anointed.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:7" id="1_Samuel-24-7">So David checked his men with these words, and didn&#8217;t allow them to rise against Saul. Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:8" id="1_Samuel-24-8">David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221; When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and showed respect.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:9" id="1_Samuel-24-9">David said to Saul, &#8220;Why do you listen to men&#8217;s words, saying, &#8216;Behold, David seeks your hurt?&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:10" id="1_Samuel-24-10">Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave. Some urged me to kill you; but I spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh&#8217;s anointed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:11" id="1_Samuel-24-11">Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn&#8217;t kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you, though you hunt for my life to take it.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:12" id="1_Samuel-24-12">May Yahweh judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand shall not be on you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:13" id="1_Samuel-24-13">As the proverb of the ancients says, &#8216;Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness;&#8217; but my hand shall not be on you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:14" id="1_Samuel-24-14">Against whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue? A dead dog? A flea?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:15" id="1_Samuel-24-15">May Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:16" id="1_Samuel-24-16">It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, &#8220;Is this your voice, my son David?&#8221; Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:17" id="1_Samuel-24-17">He said to David, &#8220;You are more righteous than I; for you have done good to me, whereas I have done evil to you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:18" id="1_Samuel-24-18">You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn&#8217;t kill me.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:19" id="1_Samuel-24-19">For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:20" id="1_Samuel-24-20">Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:21" id="1_Samuel-24-21">Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 24:22" id="1_Samuel-24-22">David swore to Saul. Saul went home; but David and his men went up to the stronghold.</span>
