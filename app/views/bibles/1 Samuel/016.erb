  <h2>1 Samuel 16</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:1" id="1_Samuel-16-1">Yahweh said to Samuel, &#8220;How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil, and go. I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite; for I have provided a king for myself among his sons.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:2" id="1_Samuel-16-2">Samuel said, &#8220;How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me.&#8221; Yahweh said, &#8220;Take a heifer with you, and say, I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:3" id="1_Samuel-16-3">Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do. You shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:4" id="1_Samuel-16-4">Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem. The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, &#8220;Do you come peaceably?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:5" id="1_Samuel-16-5">He said, &#8220;Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.&#8221; He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:6" id="1_Samuel-16-6">It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab, and said, &#8220;Surely Yahweh&#8217;s anointed is before him.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:7" id="1_Samuel-16-7">But Yahweh said to Samuel, &#8220;Don&#8217;t look on his face, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for I see not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:8" id="1_Samuel-16-8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. He said, &#8220;Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:9" id="1_Samuel-16-9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. He said, &#8220;Neither has Yahweh chosen this one.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:10" id="1_Samuel-16-10">Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Yahweh has not chosen these.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:11" id="1_Samuel-16-11">Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Are all your children here?&#8221; He said, &#8220;There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is keeping the sheep.&#8221; Samuel said to Jesse, &#8220;Send and get him; for we will not sit down until he comes here.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:12" id="1_Samuel-16-12">He sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on. Yahweh said, &#8220;Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:13" id="1_Samuel-16-13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brothers: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:14" id="1_Samuel-16-14">Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh troubled him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:15" id="1_Samuel-16-15">Saul&#8217;s servants said to him, &#8220;See now, an evil spirit from God troubles you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:16" id="1_Samuel-16-16">Let our lord now command your servants who are before you, to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp. It shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:17" id="1_Samuel-16-17">Saul said to his servants, &#8220;Provide me now a man who can play well, and bring him to me.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:18" id="1_Samuel-16-18">Then one of the young men answered, and said, &#8220;Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:19" id="1_Samuel-16-19">Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, &#8220;Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:20" id="1_Samuel-16-20">Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a young goat, and sent them by David his son to Saul.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:21" id="1_Samuel-16-21">David came to Saul, and stood before him. He loved him greatly; and he became his armor bearer.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:22" id="1_Samuel-16-22">Saul sent to Jesse, saying, &#8220;Please let David stand before me; for he has found favor in my sight.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 16:23" id="1_Samuel-16-23">It happened, when the spirit from God was on Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.</span>
