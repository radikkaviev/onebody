  <h2>1 Samuel 15</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:1" id="1_Samuel-15-1">Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel. Now therefore listen to the voice of the words of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:2" id="1_Samuel-15-2">Thus says Yahweh of Armies, &#8216;I have marked that which Amalek did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way, when he came up out of Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:3" id="1_Samuel-15-3">Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and don&#8217;t spare them; but kill both man and woman, infant and nursing baby, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:4" id="1_Samuel-15-4">Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:5" id="1_Samuel-15-5">Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:6" id="1_Samuel-15-6">Saul said to the Kenites, &#8220;Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.&#8221; So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:7" id="1_Samuel-15-7">Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:8" id="1_Samuel-15-8">He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:9" id="1_Samuel-15-9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and wouldn&#8217;t utterly destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:10" id="1_Samuel-15-10">Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:11" id="1_Samuel-15-11">&#8220;It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.&#8221; Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:12" id="1_Samuel-15-12">Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, &#8220;Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:13" id="1_Samuel-15-13">Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, &#8220;You are blessed by Yahweh! I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:14" id="1_Samuel-15-14">Samuel said, &#8220;Then what does this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the cattle which I hear mean?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:15" id="1_Samuel-15-15">Saul said, &#8220;They have brought them from the Amalekites; for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the cattle, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God. We have utterly destroyed the rest.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:16" id="1_Samuel-15-16">Then Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me last night.&#8221; He said to him, &#8220;Say on.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:17" id="1_Samuel-15-17">Samuel said, &#8220;Though you were little in your own sight, weren&#8217;t you made the head of the tribes of Israel? Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:18" id="1_Samuel-15-18">and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, &#8216;Go, and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are consumed.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:19" id="1_Samuel-15-19">Why then didn&#8217;t you obey the voice of Yahweh, but took the spoils, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:20" id="1_Samuel-15-20">Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;But I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:21" id="1_Samuel-15-21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and cattle, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:22" id="1_Samuel-15-22">Samuel said, &#8220;Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:23" id="1_Samuel-15-23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as idolatry and teraphim. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:24" id="1_Samuel-15-24">Saul said to Samuel, &#8220;I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:25" id="1_Samuel-15-25">Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:26" id="1_Samuel-15-26">Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:27" id="1_Samuel-15-27">As Samuel turned about to go away, Saul grabbed the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:28" id="1_Samuel-15-28">Samuel said to him, &#8220;Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:29" id="1_Samuel-15-29">Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:30" id="1_Samuel-15-30">Then he said, &#8220;I have sinned: yet please honor me now before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and come back with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:31" id="1_Samuel-15-31">So Samuel went back with Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:32" id="1_Samuel-15-32">Then Samuel said, &#8220;Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites!&#8221; Agag came to him cheerfully. Agag said, &#8220;Surely the bitterness of death is past.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:33" id="1_Samuel-15-33">Samuel said, &#8220;As your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women!&#8221; Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:34" id="1_Samuel-15-34">Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 15:35" id="1_Samuel-15-35">Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh grieved that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span>
