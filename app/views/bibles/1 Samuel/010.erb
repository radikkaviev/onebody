  <h2>1 Samuel 10</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:1" id="1_Samuel-10-1">Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it that Yahweh has anointed you to be prince over his inheritance?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:2" id="1_Samuel-10-2">When you have departed from me today, then you shall find two men by Rachel&#8217;s tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will tell you, &#8216;The donkeys which you went to seek have been found; and behold, your father has stopped caring about the donkeys, and is anxious for you, saying, &#8220;What shall I do for my son?&#8221;&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:3" id="1_Samuel-10-3">&#8220;Then you shall go on forward from there, and you shall come to the oak of Tabor; and three men shall meet you there going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three young goats, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:4" id="1_Samuel-10-4">and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive of their hand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:5" id="1_Samuel-10-5">&#8220;After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall happen, when you have come there to the city, that you shall meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will be prophesying:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:6" id="1_Samuel-10-6">and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:7" id="1_Samuel-10-7">Let it be, when these signs have come to you, that you do as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:8" id="1_Samuel-10-8">&#8220;You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: you shall wait seven days, until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:9" id="1_Samuel-10-9">It was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs happened that day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:10" id="1_Samuel-10-10">When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him, and he prophesied among them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:11" id="1_Samuel-10-11">It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold, he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one to another, &#8220;What is this that has come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:12" id="1_Samuel-10-12">One of the same place answered, &#8220;Who is their father?&#8221; Therefore it became a proverb, &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:13" id="1_Samuel-10-13">When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:14" id="1_Samuel-10-14">Saul&#8217;s uncle said to him and to his servant, &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To seek the donkeys. When we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:15" id="1_Samuel-10-15">Saul&#8217;s uncle said, &#8220;Please tell me what Samuel said to you.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:16" id="1_Samuel-10-16">Saul said to his uncle, &#8220;He told us plainly that the donkeys were found.&#8221; But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn&#8217;t tell him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:17" id="1_Samuel-10-17">Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:18" id="1_Samuel-10-18">and he said to the children of Israel, &#8220;Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, &#8216;I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:19" id="1_Samuel-10-19">but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves you out of all your calamities and your distresses; and you have said to him, &#8216;No! Set a king over us.&#8217; Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes, and by your thousands.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:20" id="1_Samuel-10-20">So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:21" id="1_Samuel-10-21">He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:22" id="1_Samuel-10-22">Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, &#8220;Is there yet a man to come here?&#8221; Yahweh answered, &#8220;Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:23" id="1_Samuel-10-23">They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:24" id="1_Samuel-10-24">Samuel said to all the people, &#8220;You see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?&#8221; All the people shouted, and said, &#8220;Let the king live!&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:25" id="1_Samuel-10-25">Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:26" id="1_Samuel-10-26">Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the army, whose hearts God had touched.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 10:27" id="1_Samuel-10-27">But certain worthless fellows said, &#8220;How shall this man save us?&#8221; They despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.</span>
