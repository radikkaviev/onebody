  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:1" id="1_Samuel-2-1">Hannah prayed, and said:  &#8220;My heart exults in Yahweh!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>My horn is exalted in Yahweh.<br/>   My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because I rejoice in your salvation.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:2" id="1_Samuel-2-2">There is no one as holy as Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For there is no one besides you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor is there any rock like our God.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:3" id="1_Samuel-2-3">&#8220;Talk no more so exceeding proudly.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Don&#8217;t let arrogance come out of your mouth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>By him actions are weighed.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:4" id="1_Samuel-2-4">&#8220;The bows of the mighty men are broken.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Those who stumbled are armed with strength.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:6" id="1_Samuel-2-6">&#8220;Yahweh kills, and makes alive.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:7" id="1_Samuel-2-7">Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He brings low, he also lifts up.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:8" id="1_Samuel-2-8">He raises up the poor out of the dust.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He lifts up the needy from the dunghill,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>To make them sit with princes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and inherit the throne of glory.<br/>   For the pillars of the earth are Yahweh&#8217;s.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He has set the world on them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:9" id="1_Samuel-2-9">He will keep the feet of his holy ones,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for no man shall prevail by strength.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:11" id="1_Samuel-2-11">Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. The child served Yahweh before Eli the priest.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:12" id="1_Samuel-2-12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn&#8217;t know Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:13" id="1_Samuel-2-13">The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest&#8217;s servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:14" id="1_Samuel-2-14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:15" id="1_Samuel-2-15">Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest&#8217;s servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, &#8220;Give meat to roast for the priest; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:16" id="1_Samuel-2-16">If the man said to him, &#8220;Let the fat be burned first, and then take as much as your soul desires;&#8221; then he would say, &#8220;No, but you shall give it to me now; and if not, I will take it by force.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:17" id="1_Samuel-2-17">The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:18" id="1_Samuel-2-18">But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child, clothed with a linen ephod.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:19" id="1_Samuel-2-19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:20" id="1_Samuel-2-20">Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, &#8220;Yahweh give you seed of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.&#8221; They went to their own home.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:21" id="1_Samuel-2-21">Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:22" id="1_Samuel-2-22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:23" id="1_Samuel-2-23">He said to them, &#8220;Why do you do such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:24" id="1_Samuel-2-24">No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make Yahweh&#8217;s people disobey.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:25" id="1_Samuel-2-25">If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?&#8221; Notwithstanding, they didn&#8217;t listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh intended to kill them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:26" id="1_Samuel-2-26">The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:27" id="1_Samuel-2-27">A man of God came to Eli, and said to him, &#8220;Thus says Yahweh, &#8216;Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh&#8217;s house?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:28" id="1_Samuel-2-28">Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? Did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:29" id="1_Samuel-2-29">Why do you kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings of Israel my people?&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:30" id="1_Samuel-2-30">&#8220;Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, &#8216;I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever.&#8217; But now Yahweh says, &#8216;Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:31" id="1_Samuel-2-31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father&#8217;s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:32" id="1_Samuel-2-32">You shall see the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which I shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:33" id="1_Samuel-2-33">The man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall consume your eyes, and grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:34" id="1_Samuel-2-34">&#8220;&#8216;This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:35" id="1_Samuel-2-35">I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 2:36" id="1_Samuel-2-36">It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, &#8220;Please put me into one of the priests&#8217; offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</span>
