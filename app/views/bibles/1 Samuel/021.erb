  <h2>1 Samuel 21</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:1" id="1_Samuel-21-1">Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, &#8220;Why are you alone, and no man with you?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:2" id="1_Samuel-21-2">David said to Ahimelech the priest, &#8220;The king has commanded me a business, and has said to me, &#8216;Let no man know anything of the business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you; and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:3" id="1_Samuel-21-3">Now therefore what is under your hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:4" id="1_Samuel-21-4">The priest answered David, and said, &#8220;There is no common bread under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:5" id="1_Samuel-21-5">David answered the priest, and said to him, &#8220;Truly, women have been kept from us about these three days. When I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy, though it was but a common journey. How much more then today shall their vessels be holy?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:6" id="1_Samuel-21-6">So the priest gave him holy bread; for there was no bread there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:7" id="1_Samuel-21-7">Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite, the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:8" id="1_Samuel-21-8">David said to Ahimelech, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there here under your hand spear or sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king&#8217;s business required haste.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:9" id="1_Samuel-21-9">The priest said, &#8220;The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you will take that, take it; for there is no other except that here.&#8221; David said, &#8220;There is none like that. Give it to me.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:10" id="1_Samuel-21-10">David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:11" id="1_Samuel-21-11">The servants of Achish said to him, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this David the king of the land? Didn&#8217;t they sing one to another about him in dances, saying, &#8216;Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:12" id="1_Samuel-21-12">David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid of Achish the king of Gath.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:13" id="1_Samuel-21-13">He changed his behavior before them, and pretended to be mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down on his beard.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:14" id="1_Samuel-21-14">Then Achish said to his servants, &#8220;Look, you see the man is mad. Why then have you brought him to me?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 21:15" id="1_Samuel-21-15">Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?&#8221;</span>
