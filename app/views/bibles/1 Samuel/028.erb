  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 28:14" id="1_Samuel-28-14">He said to her, &#8220;What does he look like?&#8221; She said, &#8220;An old man comes up. He is covered with a robe.&#8221; Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and showed respect.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 28:15" id="1_Samuel-28-15">Samuel said to Saul, &#8220;Why have you disturbed me, to bring me up?&#8221; Saul answered, &#8220;I am very distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams.

  <span class="verse" title="1 Samuel 28:16" id="1_Samuel-28-16">Samuel said, &#8220;Why then do you ask of me, since Yahweh has departed from you and has become your adversary?</span>
