  <h2>Ezekiel 37</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:1" id="Ezekiel-37-1">The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was full of bones.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:2" id="Ezekiel-37-2">He caused me to pass by them all around: and behold, there were very many in the open valley; and behold, they were very dry.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:3" id="Ezekiel-37-3">He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? I answered, Lord Yahweh, you know.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:4" id="Ezekiel-37-4">Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them, you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:5" id="Ezekiel-37-5">Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:6" id="Ezekiel-37-6">I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:7" id="Ezekiel-37-7">So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:8" id="Ezekiel-37-8">I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:9" id="Ezekiel-37-9">Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:10" id="Ezekiel-37-10">So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:11" id="Ezekiel-37-11">Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:12" id="Ezekiel-37-12">Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring you into the land of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:13" id="Ezekiel-37-13">You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves, and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:14" id="Ezekiel-37-14">I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land: and you shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:15" id="Ezekiel-37-15">The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:16" id="Ezekiel-37-16">You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:17" id="Ezekiel-37-17">and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:18" id="Ezekiel-37-18">When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:19" id="Ezekiel-37-19">tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them with it, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:20" id="Ezekiel-37-20">The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:21" id="Ezekiel-37-21">Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, where they are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:22" id="Ezekiel-37-22">and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:23" id="Ezekiel-37-23">neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:24" id="Ezekiel-37-24">My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:25" id="Ezekiel-37-25">They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant, in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they, and their children, and their children&#8217;s children, forever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:26" id="Ezekiel-37-26">Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:27" id="Ezekiel-37-27">My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 37:28" id="Ezekiel-37-28">The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in their midst forevermore.</span>
