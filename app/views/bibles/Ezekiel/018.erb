  <h2>Ezekiel 18</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:1" id="Ezekiel-18-1">The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:2" id="Ezekiel-18-2">What do you mean, that you use this proverb concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children&#8217;s teeth are set on edge?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:3" id="Ezekiel-18-3">As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:4" id="Ezekiel-18-4">Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul who sins, he shall die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:5" id="Ezekiel-18-5">But if a man is just, and does that which is lawful and right,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:6" id="Ezekiel-18-6">and has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor&#8217;s wife, neither has come near to a woman in her impurity,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:7" id="Ezekiel-18-7">and has not wronged any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has taken nothing by robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:8" id="Ezekiel-18-8">he who has not given forth on interest, neither has taken any increase, who has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true justice between man and man,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:9" id="Ezekiel-18-9">has walked in my statutes, and has kept my ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord Yahweh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:10" id="Ezekiel-18-10">If he fathers a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood, and who does any one of these things,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:11" id="Ezekiel-18-11">and who does not any of those duties, but even has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor&#8217;s wife,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:12" id="Ezekiel-18-12">has wronged the poor and needy, has taken by robbery, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:13" id="Ezekiel-18-13">has given forth on interest, and has taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live: he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be on him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:14" id="Ezekiel-18-14">Now, behold, if he fathers a son, who sees all his father&#8217;s sins, which he has done, and fears, and does not such like;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:15" id="Ezekiel-18-15">who has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his neighbor&#8217;s wife,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:16" id="Ezekiel-18-16">neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge, neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:17" id="Ezekiel-18-17">who has withdrawn his hand from the poor, who has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:18" id="Ezekiel-18-18">As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he shall die in his iniquity.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:19" id="Ezekiel-18-19">Yet you say, Why doesn&#8217;t the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:20" id="Ezekiel-18-20">The soul who sins, he shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:21" id="Ezekiel-18-21">But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:22" id="Ezekiel-18-22">None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he has done he shall live.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:23" id="Ezekiel-18-23">Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Lord Yahweh; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:24" id="Ezekiel-18-24">But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:25" id="Ezekiel-18-25">Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, house of Israel: Is my way not equal? Aren&#8217;t your ways unequal?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:26" id="Ezekiel-18-26">When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies therein; in his iniquity that he has done shall he die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:27" id="Ezekiel-18-27">Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:28" id="Ezekiel-18-28">Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:29" id="Ezekiel-18-29">Yet the house of Israel says, &#8220;The way of the Lord is not fair.&#8221; House of Israel, aren&#8217;t my ways fair? Aren&#8217;t your ways unfair?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:30" id="Ezekiel-18-30">Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, everyone according to his ways, says the Lord Yahweh. Return, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:31" id="Ezekiel-18-31">Cast away from you all your transgressions, in which you have transgressed; and make yourself a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, house of Israel?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 18:32" id="Ezekiel-18-32">For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says the Lord Yahweh: therefore turn yourselves, and live.</span>
