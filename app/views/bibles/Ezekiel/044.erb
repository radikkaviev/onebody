  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 44:2" id="Ezekiel-44-2">Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 44:3" id="Ezekiel-44-3">As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread before Yahweh; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 44:7" id="Ezekiel-44-7">in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant, to add to all your abominations.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 44:8" id="Ezekiel-44-8">You have not performed the duty of my holy things; but you have set performers of my duty in my sanctuary for yourselves.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Ezekiel 44:12" id="Ezekiel-44-12">Because they ministered to them before their idols, and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, says the Lord Yahweh, and they shall bear their iniquity.</span>
