  <span class="verse" title="Genesis 48:4" id="Genesis-48-4">and said to me, &#8216;Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Genesis 48:5" id="Genesis-48-5">Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Genesis 48:10" id="Genesis-48-10">Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn&#8217;t see. He brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Genesis 48:17" id="Genesis-48-17">When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He held up his father&#8217;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim&#8217;s head to Manasseh&#8217;s head.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Genesis 48:18" id="Genesis-48-18">Joseph said to his father, &#8220;Not so, my father; for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.&#8221;</span>
