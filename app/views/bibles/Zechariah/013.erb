  <h2>Zechariah 13</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:1" id="Zechariah-13-1">&#8220;In that day there will be a spring opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:2" id="Zechariah-13-2">It will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of Armies, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they will be remembered no more. I will also cause the prophets and the spirit of impurity to pass out of the land.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:3" id="Zechariah-13-3">It will happen that, when anyone still prophesies, then his father and his mother who bore him will tell him, &#8216;You must die, because you speak lies in the name of Yahweh;&#8217; and his father and his mother who bore him will stab him when he prophesies.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:4" id="Zechariah-13-4">It will happen in that day, that the prophets will each be ashamed of his vision, when he prophesies; neither will they wear a hairy mantle to deceive:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:5" id="Zechariah-13-5">but he will say, &#8216;I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondservant from my youth.&#8217;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:6" id="Zechariah-13-6">One will say to him, &#8216;What are these wounds between your arms?&#8217; Then he will answer, &#8216;Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.&#8217;  <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:7" id="Zechariah-13-7">&#8220;Awake, sword, against my shepherd,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and against the man who is close to me,&#8221; says Yahweh of Armies.<br/>   &#8220;Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will turn my hand against the little ones.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:8" id="Zechariah-13-8">It shall happen that in all the land,&#8221; says Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;two parts in it will be cut off and die;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but the third will be left in it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 13:9" id="Zechariah-13-9">I will bring the third part into the fire,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will refine them as silver is refined,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will test them like gold is tested.<br/>   They will call on my name, and I will hear them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will say, &#8216;It is my people;&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will say, &#8216;Yahweh is my God.&#8217;&#8221;<br/></span>
