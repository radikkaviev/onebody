  <h2>Zechariah 9</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:1" id="Zechariah-9-1">An oracle.  The word of Yahweh is against the land of Hadrach,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will rest upon Damascus;<br/>   for the eye of man<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and of all the tribes of Israel is toward Yahweh;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:2" id="Zechariah-9-2">and Hamath, also, which borders on it;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:3" id="Zechariah-9-3">Tyre built herself a stronghold,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and heaped up silver like the dust,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and fine gold like the mire of the streets.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:4" id="Zechariah-9-4">Behold, the Lord will dispossess her,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will strike her power in the sea;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and she will be devoured with fire.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:5" id="Zechariah-9-5">Ashkelon will see it, and fear;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gaza also, and will writhe in agony;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as will Ekron, for her expectation will be disappointed;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the king will perish from Gaza,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Ashkelon will not be inhabited.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:6" id="Zechariah-9-6">Foreigners will dwell in Ashdod,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:7" id="Zechariah-9-7">I will take away his blood out of his mouth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his abominations from between his teeth;<br/>   and he also will be a remnant for our God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will be as a chieftain in Judah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Ekron as a Jebusite.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:8" id="Zechariah-9-8">I will encamp around my house against the army,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that none pass through or return;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and no oppressor will pass through them any more:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for now I have seen with my eyes.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:9" id="Zechariah-9-9">Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Shout, daughter of Jerusalem!<br/>   Behold, your King comes to you!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He is righteous, and having salvation;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lowly, and riding on a donkey,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:10" id="Zechariah-9-10">I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the horse from Jerusalem;<br/>   and the battle bow will be cut off;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will speak peace to the nations:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his dominion will be from sea to sea,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from the River to the ends of the earth.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:11" id="Zechariah-9-11">As for you also,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because of the blood of your covenant,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have set free your prisoners from the pit in which is no water.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:12" id="Zechariah-9-12">Turn to the stronghold, you prisoners of hope!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even today I declare that I will restore double to you.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:13" id="Zechariah-9-13">For indeed I bend Judah as a bow for me.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have filled the bow with Ephraim;<br/>   and I will stir up your sons, Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>against your sons, Greece,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will make you like the sword of a mighty man.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:14" id="Zechariah-9-14">Yahweh will be seen over them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and his arrow will go flash like lightning;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the Lord Yahweh will blow the trumpet,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will go with whirlwinds of the south.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:15" id="Zechariah-9-15">Yahweh of Armies will defend them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will destroy and overcome with sling stones;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will drink, and roar as through wine;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will be filled like bowls,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like the corners of the altar.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:16" id="Zechariah-9-16">Yahweh their God will save them in that day as the flock of his people;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for they are like the jewels of a crown,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lifted on high over his land.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Zechariah 9:17" id="Zechariah-9-17">For how great is his goodness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and how great is his beauty!<br/>   Grain will make the young men flourish,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and new wine the virgins.<br/></span>
