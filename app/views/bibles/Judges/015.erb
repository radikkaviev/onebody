  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:2" id="Judges-15-2">Her father said, &#8220;I most certainly thought that you had utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion. Isn&#8217;t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her, instead.&#8221;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:7" id="Judges-15-7">Samson said to them, &#8220;If you behave like this, surely I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.&#8221;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:11" id="Judges-15-11">Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us?&#8221; He said to them, &#8220;As they did to me, so have I done to them.&#8221;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:13" id="Judges-15-13">They spoke to him, saying, &#8220;No; but we will bind you fast, and deliver you into their hand; but surely we will not kill you.&#8221; They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:14" id="Judges-15-14">When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him: and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands dropped from off his hands.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:17" id="Judges-15-17">It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 15:18" id="Judges-15-18">He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, &#8220;You have given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?&#8221;</span>
