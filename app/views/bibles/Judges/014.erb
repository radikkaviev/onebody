  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:2" id="Judges-14-2">He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, &#8220;I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me as wife.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:3" id="Judges-14-3">Then his father and his mother said to him, &#8220;Is there never a woman among the daughters of your brothers, or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?&#8221; Samson said to his father, &#8220;Get her for me; for she pleases me well.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:4" id="Judges-14-4">But his father and his mother didn&#8217;t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:5" id="Judges-14-5">Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and behold, a young lion roared against him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:6" id="Judges-14-6">The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a young goat; and he had nothing in his hand: but he didn&#8217;t tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:12" id="Judges-14-12">Samson said to them, &#8220;Let me tell you a riddle now. If you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:13" id="Judges-14-13">but if you can&#8217;t declare it to me, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.&#8221; They said to him, &#8220;Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.&#8221;</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:15" id="Judges-14-15">It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson&#8217;s wife, &#8220;Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father&#8217;s house with fire. Have you called us to impoverish us? Is it not so?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:16" id="Judges-14-16">Samson&#8217;s wife wept before him, and said, &#8220;You just hate me, and don&#8217;t love me. You have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven&#8217;t told it me.&#8221; He said to her, &#8220;Behold, I haven&#8217;t told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:17" id="Judges-14-17">She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span>

  <span class="verse" title="Judges 14:20" id="Judges-14-20">But Samson&#8217;s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</span>
