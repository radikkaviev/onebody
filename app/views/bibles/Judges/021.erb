  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:2" id="Judges-21-2">The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept severely.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:3" id="Judges-21-3">They said, &#8220;Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:4" id="Judges-21-4">It happened on the next day that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:5" id="Judges-21-5">The children of Israel said, &#8220;Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who didn&#8217;t come up in the assembly to Yahweh?&#8221; For they had made a great oath concerning him who didn&#8217;t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, &#8220;He shall surely be put to death.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:6" id="Judges-21-6">The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, &#8220;There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:7" id="Judges-21-7">How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our daughters to wives?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:8" id="Judges-21-8">They said, &#8220;What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn&#8217;t come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?&#8221; Behold, there came none to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:9" id="Judges-21-9">For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:10" id="Judges-21-10">The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant, and commanded them, saying, &#8220;Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the little ones.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:11" id="Judges-21-11">This is the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has lain with a man.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:12" id="Judges-21-12">They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:13" id="Judges-21-13">The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:14" id="Judges-21-14">Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead: and yet so they weren&#8217;t enough for them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:15" id="Judges-21-15">The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:16" id="Judges-21-16">Then the elders of the congregation said, &#8220;How shall we provide wives for those who remain, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:17" id="Judges-21-17">They said, &#8220;There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:18" id="Judges-21-18">However we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, &#8216;Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:19" id="Judges-21-19">They said, &#8220;Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:20" id="Judges-21-20">They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, &#8220;Go and lie in wait in the vineyards,</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:21" id="Judges-21-21">and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:22" id="Judges-21-22">It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say to them, &#8216;Grant them graciously to us, because we didn&#8217;t take for each man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, otherwise you would now be guilty.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:23" id="Judges-21-23">The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:24" id="Judges-21-24">The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 21:25" id="Judges-21-25">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</span>
