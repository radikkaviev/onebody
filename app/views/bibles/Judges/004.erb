  <h2>Judges 4</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:1" id="Judges-4-1">The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:2" id="Judges-4-2">Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:3" id="Judges-4-3">The children of Israel cried to Yahweh: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:4" id="Judges-4-4">Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:5" id="Judges-4-5">She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:6" id="Judges-4-6">She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded, &#8216;Go and draw to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:7" id="Judges-4-7">I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin&#8217;s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:8" id="Judges-4-8">Barak said to her, &#8220;If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:9" id="Judges-4-9">She said, &#8220;I will surely go with you: nevertheless, the journey that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.&#8221; Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:10" id="Judges-4-10">Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:11" id="Judges-4-11">Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:12" id="Judges-4-12">They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to Mount Tabor.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:13" id="Judges-4-13">Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:14" id="Judges-4-14">Deborah said to Barak, &#8220;Go; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand. Hasn&#8217;t Yahweh gone out before you?&#8221; So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:15" id="Judges-4-15">Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:16" id="Judges-4-16">But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:17" id="Judges-4-17">However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:18" id="Judges-4-18">Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, &#8220;Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221; He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:19" id="Judges-4-19">He said to her, &#8220;Please give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.&#8221; She opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:20" id="Judges-4-20">He said to her, &#8220;Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, &#8216;Is there any man here?&#8217; that you shall say, &#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221;</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:21" id="Judges-4-21">Then Jael Heber&#8217;s wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:22" id="Judges-4-22">Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, &#8220;Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.&#8221; He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent peg was in his temples.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:23" id="Judges-4-23">So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Judges 4:24" id="Judges-4-24">The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span>
