  <h2>Joel 3</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:1" id="Joel-3-1">&#8220;For, behold, in those days,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and in that time,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:2" id="Joel-3-2">I will gather all nations,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They have divided my land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:3" id="Joel-3-3">and have cast lots for my people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and have given a boy for a prostitute,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:4" id="Joel-3-4">&#8220;Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and all the regions of Philistia?<br/>   Will you repay me?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And if you repay me,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:5" id="Joel-3-5">Because you have taken my silver and my gold,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:6" id="Joel-3-6">and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that you may remove them far from their border.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:7" id="Joel-3-7">Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will return your repayment on your own head;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:8" id="Joel-3-8">and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will sell them to the men of Sheba,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to a faraway nation,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh has spoken it.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:9" id="Joel-3-9">Proclaim this among the nations:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Prepare for war!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Stir up the mighty men.<br/>   Let all the warriors draw near.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let them come up.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:10" id="Joel-3-10">Beat your plowshares into swords,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and your pruning hooks into spears.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Let the weak say, &#8216;I am strong.&#8217;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:11" id="Joel-3-11">Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and gather yourselves together.&#8221;<br/>   Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:12" id="Joel-3-12">&#8220;Let the nations arouse themselves,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:13" id="Joel-3-13">Put in the sickle;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the harvest is ripe.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Come, tread, for the winepress is full,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:14" id="Joel-3-14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:15" id="Joel-3-15">The sun and the moon are darkened,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the stars withdraw their shining.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:16" id="Joel-3-16">Yahweh will roar from Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and thunder from Jerusalem;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the heavens and the earth will shake;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a stronghold to the children of Israel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:17" id="Joel-3-17">&#8220;So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.<br/>   Then Jerusalem will be holy,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and no strangers will pass through her any more.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:18" id="Joel-3-18">It will happen in that day,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the hills will flow with milk,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will water the valley of Shittim.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:19" id="Joel-3-19">Egypt will be a desolation,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the violence done to the children of Judah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>because they have shed innocent blood in their land.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:20" id="Joel-3-20">But Judah will be inhabited forever,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Jerusalem from generation to generation.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 3:21" id="Joel-3-21">I will cleanse their blood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that I have not cleansed:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for Yahweh dwells in Zion.&#8221;<br/>   <br/></span>
