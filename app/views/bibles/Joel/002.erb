  <h2>Joel 2</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:1" id="Joel-2-1">Blow the trumpet in Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!<br/>   Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the day of Yahweh comes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for it is close at hand:<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:2" id="Joel-2-2">A day of darkness and gloominess,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a day of clouds and thick darkness.<br/>   As the dawn spreading on the mountains,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>a great and strong people;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>there has never been the like,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither will there be any more after them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even to the years of many generations.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:3" id="Joel-2-3">A fire devours before them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and behind them, a flame burns.<br/>   The land is as the garden of Eden before them,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and behind them, a desolate wilderness.<br/>   Yes, and no one has escaped them.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:4" id="Joel-2-4">Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and as horsemen, so do they run.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:5" id="Joel-2-5">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as a strong people set in battle array.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:6" id="Joel-2-6">At their presence the peoples are in anguish.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All faces have grown pale.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:7" id="Joel-2-7">They run like mighty men.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They climb the wall like warriors.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They each march in his line, and they don&#8217;t swerve off course.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:8" id="Joel-2-8">Neither does one jostle another;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they march everyone in his path,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they burst through the defenses,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and don&#8217;t break ranks.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:9" id="Joel-2-9">They rush on the city.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They run on the wall.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They climb up into the houses.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>They enter in at the windows like thieves.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:10" id="Joel-2-10">The earth quakes before them.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The heavens tremble.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sun and the moon are darkened,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the stars withdraw their shining.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:11" id="Joel-2-11">Yahweh thunders his voice before his army;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for his forces are very great;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for he is strong who obeys his command;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and who can endure it?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:12" id="Joel-2-12">&#8220;Yet even now,&#8221; says Yahweh, &#8220;turn to me with all your heart,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:13" id="Joel-2-13">Tear your heart, and not your garments,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and turn to Yahweh, your God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for he is gracious and merciful,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and relents from sending calamity.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:14" id="Joel-2-14">Who knows? He may turn and relent,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and leave a blessing behind him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh, your God.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:15" id="Joel-2-15">Blow the trumpet in Zion!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sanctify a fast.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Call a solemn assembly.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:16" id="Joel-2-16">Gather the people.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sanctify the assembly.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Assemble the elders.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gather the children, and those who nurse from breasts.<br/>   Let the bridegroom go forth from his room,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the bride out of her room.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:17" id="Joel-2-17">Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and let them say, &#8220;Spare your people, Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and don&#8217;t give your heritage to reproach,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that the nations should rule over them.<br/>   Why should they say among the peoples,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8216;Where is their God?&#8217;&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:18" id="Joel-2-18">Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And had pity on his people.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:19" id="Joel-2-19">Yahweh answered his people,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Behold, I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you will be satisfied with them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:20" id="Joel-2-20">But I will remove the northern army far away from you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>its front into the eastern sea,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and its back into the western sea;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and its stench will come up,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and its bad smell will rise.&#8221;<br/>   Surely he has done great things.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:21" id="Joel-2-21">Land, don&#8217;t be afraid.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has done great things.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:22" id="Joel-2-22">Don&#8217;t be afraid, you animals of the field;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for the tree bears its fruit.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:23" id="Joel-2-23">&#8220;Be glad then, you children of Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for he gives you the former rain in just measure,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he causes the rain to come down for you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the former rain and the latter rain,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as before.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:24" id="Joel-2-24">The threshing floors will be full of wheat,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:25" id="Joel-2-25">I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the great locust, the grasshopper, and the caterpillar,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>my great army, which I sent among you.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:26" id="Joel-2-26">You will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who has dealt wondrously with you;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and my people will never again be disappointed.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:27" id="Joel-2-27">You will know that I am in the midst of Israel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and that I am Yahweh, your God, and there is no one else;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and my people will never again be disappointed.<br/>   <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:28" id="Joel-2-28">&#8220;It will happen afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your old men will dream dreams.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Your young men will see visions.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:29" id="Joel-2-29">And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will pour out my Spirit.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:30" id="Joel-2-30">I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:31" id="Joel-2-31">The sun will be turned into darkness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the moon into blood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Joel 2:32" id="Joel-2-32">It will happen that whoever will call on the name of Yahweh shall be saved;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as Yahweh has said,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and among the remnant, those whom Yahweh calls.<br/>   <br/></span>
