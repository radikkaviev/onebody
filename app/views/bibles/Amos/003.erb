  <h2>Amos 3</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:1" id="Amos-3-1">Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:2" id="Amos-3-2">&#8220;You only have I chosen of all the families of the earth.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will punish you for all of your sins.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:3" id="Amos-3-3">Do two walk together,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>unless they have agreed?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:4" id="Amos-3-4">Will a lion roar in the thicket,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>when he has no prey?<br/>   Does a young lion cry out of his den,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>if he has caught nothing?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:5" id="Amos-3-5">Can a bird fall in a trap on the earth,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>where no snare is set for him?<br/>   Does a snare spring up from the ground,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>when there is nothing to catch?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:6" id="Amos-3-6">Does the trumpet alarm sound in a city,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>without the people being afraid?<br/>   Does evil happen to a city,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Yahweh hasn&#8217;t done it?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:7" id="Amos-3-7">Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>unless he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:8" id="Amos-3-8">The lion has roared.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who will not fear?<br/>   The Lord Yahweh has spoken.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Who can but prophesy?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:9" id="Amos-3-9">Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and in the palaces in the land of Egypt,<br/>   and say, &#8220;Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and see what unrest is in her,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and what oppression is among them.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:10" id="Amos-3-10">&#8220;Indeed they don&#8217;t know to do right,&#8221; says Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Who hoard plunder and loot in their palaces.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:11" id="Amos-3-11">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  &#8220;An adversary will overrun the land;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and he will pull down your strongholds,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and your fortresses will be plundered.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:12" id="Amos-3-12">Thus says Yahweh:  &#8220;As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>or a piece of an ear,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so shall the children of Israel be rescued who sit in Samaria on the corner of a couch,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and on the silken cushions of a bed.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:13" id="Amos-3-13">&#8220;Listen, and testify against the house of Jacob,&#8221; says the Lord Yahweh, the God of Armies.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:14" id="Amos-3-14">&#8220;For in the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel on him,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will also visit the altars of Bethel;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the horns of the altar will be cut off,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and fall to the ground.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 3:15" id="Amos-3-15">I will strike the winter house with the summer house;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the houses of ivory will perish,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the great houses will have an end,&#8221;<br/>  says Yahweh.</span>
