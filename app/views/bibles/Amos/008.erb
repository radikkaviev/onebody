  <h2>Amos 8</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:1" id="Amos-8-1">Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: behold, a basket of summer fruit.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:2" id="Amos-8-2">He said, &#8220;Amos, what do you see?&#8221; I said, &#8220;A basket of summer fruit.&#8221; Then Yahweh said to me,  &#8220;The end has come on my people Israel.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will not again pass by them any more.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:3" id="Amos-8-3">The songs of the temple will be wailings in that day,&#8221; says the Lord Yahweh.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;The dead bodies will be many. In every place they will throw them out with silence.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:4" id="Amos-8-4">Hear this, you who desire to swallow up the needy,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and cause the poor of the land to fail,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:5" id="Amos-8-5">Saying, &#8216;When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>And the Sabbath, that we may market wheat,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>making the ephah small, and the shekel large,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and dealing falsely with balances of deceit;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:6" id="Amos-8-6">that we may buy the poor for silver,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the needy for a pair of shoes,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and sell the sweepings with the wheat?&#8217;&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:7" id="Amos-8-7">Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;Surely I will never forget any of their works.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:8" id="Amos-8-8">Won&#8217;t the land tremble for this,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and everyone mourn who dwells in it?<br/>   Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it will be stirred up and sink again, like the River of Egypt.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:9" id="Amos-8-9">It will happen in that day,&#8221; says the Lord Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;that I will cause the sun to go down at noon,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will darken the earth in the clear day.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:10" id="Amos-8-10">I will turn your feasts into mourning,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and all your songs into lamentation;<br/>   and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and baldness on every head.<br/>   I will make it like the mourning for an only son,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and its end like a bitter day.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:11" id="Amos-8-11">Behold, the days come,&#8221; says the Lord Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;that I will send a famine in the land,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>not a famine of bread,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor a thirst for water,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but of hearing the words of Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:12" id="Amos-8-12">They will wander from sea to sea,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from the north even to the east;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they will run back and forth to seek the word of Yahweh,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and will not find it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:13" id="Amos-8-13">In that day the beautiful virgins<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the young men will faint for thirst.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 8:14" id="Amos-8-14">Those who swear by the sin of Samaria,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and say, &#8216;As your god, Dan, lives;&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and, &#8216;As the way of Beersheba lives;&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>they will fall, and never rise up again.&#8221;<br/></span>
