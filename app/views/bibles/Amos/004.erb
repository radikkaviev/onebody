  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:2" id="Amos-4-2">The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness that behold,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;The days shall come on you that they will take you away with hooks,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the last of you with fish hooks.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:3" id="Amos-4-3">You will go out at the breaks in the wall,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>everyone straight before her;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you will cast yourselves into Harmon,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:4" id="Amos-4-4">&#8220;Go to Bethel, and sin;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to Gilgal, and sin more.<br/>   Bring your sacrifices every morning,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>your tithes every three days,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:5" id="Amos-4-5">offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and proclaim free will offerings and brag about them:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for this pleases you, you children of Israel,&#8221; says the Lord Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:6" id="Amos-4-6">&#8220;I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and lack of bread in every town;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet you haven&#8217;t returned to me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:8" id="Amos-4-8">So two or three cities staggered to one city to drink water,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and were not satisfied:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet you haven&#8217;t returned to me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:9" id="Amos-4-9">&#8220;I struck you with blight and mildew many times in your gardens and your vineyards;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and your fig trees and your olive trees have the swarming locust devoured:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet you haven&#8217;t returned to me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:10" id="Amos-4-10">&#8220;I sent plagues among you like I did Egypt.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have slain your young men with the sword,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and have carried away your horses;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camp,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet you haven&#8217;t returned to me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 4:11" id="Amos-4-11">&#8220;I have overthrown some of you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and you were like a burning stick plucked out of the fire;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>yet you haven&#8217;t returned to me,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
