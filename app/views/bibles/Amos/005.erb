  <h2>Amos 5</h2>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:1" id="Amos-5-1">Listen to this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:2" id="Amos-5-2">&#8220;The virgin of Israel has fallen;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>She shall rise no more.<br/>   She is cast down on her land;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>there is no one to raise her up.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:3" id="Amos-5-3">For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  &#8220;The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left to the house of Israel.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:4" id="Amos-5-4">For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel:  &#8220;Seek me, and you will live;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:5" id="Amos-5-5">but don&#8217;t seek Bethel,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>nor enter into Gilgal,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and don&#8217;t pass to Beersheba:<br/>   for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and Bethel shall come to nothing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:6" id="Amos-5-6">Seek Yahweh, and you will live;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and it devour, and there be no one to quench it in Bethel.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:7" id="Amos-5-7">You who turn justice to wormwood,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and cast down righteousness to the earth:<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:8" id="Amos-5-8">seek him who made the Pleiades and Orion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and turns the shadow of death into the morning,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and makes the day dark with night;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who calls for the waters of the sea,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and pours them out on the surface of the earth, Yahweh is his name,<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:9" id="Amos-5-9">who brings sudden destruction on the strong,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>so that destruction comes on the fortress.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:10" id="Amos-5-10">They hate him who reproves in the gate,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:11" id="Amos-5-11">Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and take taxes from him of wheat:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>You have built houses of cut stone,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but you will not dwell in them.<br/>   You have planted pleasant vineyards,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but you shall not drink their wine.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:12" id="Amos-5-12">For I know how many your offenses,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and how great are your sinsâ€”<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>you who afflict the just,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who take a bribe,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and who turn aside the needy in the courts.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:13" id="Amos-5-13">Therefore a prudent person keeps silent in such a time,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for it is an evil time.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:14" id="Amos-5-14">Seek good, and not evil,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that you may live;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and so Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be with you,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>as you say.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:15" id="Amos-5-15">Hate evil, love good,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and establish justice in the courts.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It may be that Yahweh, the God of Armies, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.&#8221;<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:16" id="Amos-5-16">Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the Lord:  &#8220;Wailing will be in all the broad ways;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will say in all the streets, &#8216;Alas! Alas!&#8217;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and they will call the farmer to mourning,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and those who are skillful in lamentation to wailing.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:17" id="Amos-5-17">In all vineyards there will be wailing;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>for I will pass through the midst of you,&#8221; says Yahweh.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:18" id="Amos-5-18">&#8220;Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why do you long for the day of Yahweh?<br/>   It is darkness,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and not light.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:19" id="Amos-5-19">As if a man fled from a lion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a bear met him;<br/>   Or he went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and a snake bit him.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:20" id="Amos-5-20">Won&#8217;t the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Even very dark, and no brightness in it?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:21" id="Amos-5-21">I hate, I despise your feasts,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I can&#8217;t stand your solemn assemblies.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:22" id="Amos-5-22">Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal offerings,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will not accept them;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat animals.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:23" id="Amos-5-23">Take away from me the noise of your songs!<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I will not listen to the music of your harps.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:24" id="Amos-5-24">But let justice roll on like rivers,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and righteousness like a mighty stream.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:25" id="Amos-5-25">&#8220;Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:26" id="Amos-5-26">You also carried the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made for yourselves.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 5:27" id="Amos-5-27">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,&#8221; says Yahweh, whose name is the God of Armies.</span>
