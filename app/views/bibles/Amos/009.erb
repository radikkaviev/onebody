  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:2" id="Amos-9-2">Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:3" id="Amos-9-3">Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:4" id="Amos-9-4">Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:5" id="Amos-9-5">For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:6" id="Amos-9-6">It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:7" id="Amos-9-7">Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?&#8221; says Yahweh. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 9:8" id="Amos-9-8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,&#8221; says Yahweh.</span>
