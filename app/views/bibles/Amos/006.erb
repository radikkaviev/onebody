  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:1" id="Amos-6-1">Woe to those who are at ease in Zion,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and to those who are secure on the mountain of Samaria,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>the notable men of the chief of the nations,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>to whom the house of Israel come!<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:2" id="Amos-6-2">Go to Calneh, and see;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and from there go to Hamath the great;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>then go down to Gath of the Philistines.<br/>   are they better than these kingdoms?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>or is their border greater than your border?<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:3" id="Amos-6-3">Those who put far away the evil day,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and cause the seat of violence to come near;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:4" id="Amos-6-4">Who lie on beds of ivory,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and stretch themselves on their couches,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and eat the lambs out of the flock,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the calves out of the midst of the stall;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:5" id="Amos-6-5">who strum on the strings of a harp;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:6" id="Amos-6-6">who drink wine in bowls,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and anoint themselves with the best oils;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:7" id="Amos-6-7">Therefore they will now go captive with the first who go captive;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the feasting and lounging will end.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:8" id="Amos-6-8">&#8220;The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself,&#8221; says Yahweh, the God of Armies:<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;I abhor the pride of Jacob,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and detest his fortresses.<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Therefore I will deliver up the city with all that is in it.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:9" id="Amos-6-9">It will happen, if there remain ten men in one house,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>that they shall die.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:10" id="Amos-6-10">&#8220;When a man&#8217;s relative carries him, even he who burns him, to bring bodies out of the house, and asks him who is in the innermost parts of the house, &#8216;Is there yet any with you?&#8217; And he says, &#8216;No;&#8217; then he will say, &#8216;Hush! Indeed we must not mention the name of Yahweh.&#8217;  <br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:11" id="Amos-6-11">&#8220;For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house will be smashed to pieces,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the little house into bits.<br/></span>
  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:12" id="Amos-6-12">Do horses run on the rocky crags?<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Does one plow there with oxen?<br/>   But you have turned justice into poison,<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness;<br/></span>

  <span class="verse" title="Amos 6:14" id="Amos-6-14">For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel,&#8221;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>says Yahweh, the God of Armies;<br/> <span class="indent">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&#8220;and they will afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.&#8221;<br/></span>
