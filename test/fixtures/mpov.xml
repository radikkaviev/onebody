<blockquote><p>What we don&#8217;t see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>There seems to be a general dissatisfaction with politics amongst people my age. We have a bad taste in our mouths. We&#8217;ve grown up watching a political process that seems to only happen on our TVs. And we feel we have absolutely no power to influence it. Because it&#8217;s a one-way channel.</p>
<p>In some ways, the whole process is like a bad television show.</p>
<p>The things we learned in grade school and high school (at a time when we were too young to participate) made the system seem beautifully complex and perfectly designed. There was a pride accompanied with our nation and its government, branches, and elections. <span style="font-style:italic;">The people have the power to change things</span>, we were told.</p>
<p>But then we grew up. And realized we aren&#8217;t as powerful as our teachers told us.</p>
<p>Just as the shallow story arcs and tired recurring villain ideas of <span style="font-style:italic;">Smallville</span> have all but caused us to delete our Season Pass from the TiVo, the U.S. political process seems out of touch, repetitious, and generally obsessed with continuing with the status quo. And Americans are OK with that.</p>
<p>It seems my age group doesn&#8217;t want to invest time in something they feel will never change. It&#8217;s too heartbreaking to put effort into something to find that nothing is different. There are just too many people out there with more money, time, and influence (e.g. the Media corporations and their superstar news pundits) that influence too many Americans.</p>
<p>Choosing a political candidate has become likened to choosing a toothpaste or laundry detergent. We watch this new cycle of elections unfold on our television screens (usually as it interrupts our favorite sitcom or drama series in the form of a political mud slinging ad or evening &#8220;news&#8221; about the same three candidates). A few names stick and that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Or we feel the only choice we have is a political party. A lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>Is this the way it has to be?</p>
<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why I think we can actually make a difference: the Internet.</p>
<p>While the mainstream media is busy covering a select few, and leaving the other candidates out, guess what&#8217;s happening online? People are given a voice again and they&#8217;re using this new medium to talk about the candidates who&#8217;ll really change something, uncensored by big media corporations with something to gain from one candidate or another.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_videos&amp;search_query=president&amp;search_sort=video_avg_rating&amp;search_category=0">check out</a> the top rated presidential candidate YouTube videos. And the <a href="http://www.techpresident.com/youtube">rate of growth</a> of a few outstanding candidates on YouTube. Ron Paul is one of the most searched for terms on blogs according to <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/">Technorati</a>, too. He surges ahead online because of his message and the free flow of that message across this medium.</p>
<p>And these are just a few examples. Check out <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=132x3298015">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.freecentury.com/2007/06/10/update-ron-paul-fastest-growing-myspace-candidate/">MySpace</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/popular/30days">Digg</a>, and elsewhere on the Web and you&#8217;ll probably find something about Ron Paul.</p>
<p>I challenge you to do some surfing and find out which candidate you like the best. While it&#8217;s not in a nice little box like you&#8217;ll see on a big news channel, and it is quite raw, I think you&#8217;ll find that  there is somebody who can turn this country around. Unless of course you like the way things are going now &#8212; in that case, just keep watching TV. Someone else will decide for you.</p>
<p>There is a chance for our age group to have a voice. And now is the time.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still waiting on an API key so I can test my Flickr migration script. I wrote a bit of Ruby to download each of my Flickr photos, along with their tags, geotags, description, title, etc. and upload them one by one to Zooomr. I&#8217;m anxious to see if it works.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think it will be neat to have my photos in two places on the Web.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Have you ever been downloading something very large for a long time, and something happens to interrupt it? Firefox crashes, you lose power, you accidentally close your laptop lid, etc.? Here&#8217;s a trick to start your download where you left off:</p>
<ol>
<li>On Linux, you can skip this step. On Mac, download wget <a href="http://www.statusq.org/archives/2005/02/22/610/">here</a>, unzip it, and put &#8220;wget&#8221; in <code>/usr/bin</code>.  For Windows, looks like you can download wget <a href="http://pages.interlog.com/~tcharron/wgetwin.html">here</a> (I haven&#8217;t tried this on Windows, but it shouldn&#8217;t be much different).</li>
<li>In a terminal window, run <code>wget -c http://url/to/download</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>-c</code> tells wget to &#8220;continue&#8221; the download. Even if you started your download in some other program, wget starts again where you left off. Pretty sweet, huh?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class='snap_preview'><p>Greg makes <a href="http://gregpittman.com/?p=17">an extreme point</a> to show that people often go off the deep end when it comes to church and Christ + hypocrites. Here&#8217;s the scoop for those who haven&#8217;t figured it out: <em>People</em> are hypocrites. How many times have you said something but done something completely different? I think if I&#8217;m honest with myself, I&#8217;d admit it happens about every day.</p>
<p>Every night I think <em>I&#8217;m going to wake up early</em>, every day I say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to eat healthier for lunch.&#8221; If we can lie to ourselves on a regular basis unintentionally, why is it such a shocker that people do it in public, too?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I have a point in there somewhere&#8230; basically, I wish people would give us Christians a break &#8212; hold us accountable, yes &#8212; but don&#8217;t say &#8220;I won&#8217;t go to church because it&#8217;s full of hypocrites.&#8221; We&#8217;re trying to be full of integrity, but oftentimes our human nature comes out. That&#8217;s the real point.</p>
