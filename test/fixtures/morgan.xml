We've had a great couple of days! On Tuesday Mac crawled almost 20 feet while playing, she said "daddy" in sign language, and moved her arms and legs in swim class like she was swimming. Today Mac crawled over to the couch and pulled herself up to standing. We think she's cutting some more teeth. So she is developing so quickly. Once she decides she can do something, she does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves playing with musical toys. She has a puppy that sings songs when you push the tummy, feet, hands, and ears. Mac finally "gets it" and will push different parts of the puppy then dance to the music. She loves her "First Sign's" DVD and is beginning to enjoy her "First Move's" DVD, both by Baby Einstein. She still loves her bear-blanket. We're trying to look for another one to buy so we can have plenty clean and ready for her all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are so thankful that God has blessed Tim and me with such a beautiful and wonderful baby girl. We pray that she would continue to develop into a healthy, strong, and loving child of God.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/07/mac-is-crawling.html' title='Mac is crawling'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=8538172566534050510' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/8538172566534050510'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/8538172566534050510'/><author><name>Jennie Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-2742258326260147962</id><published>2007-07-16T07:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-07-16T16:13:54.212-05:00</updated><title type='text'>How To Read 54 Blogs Every Day</title><content type='html'>Friends are often commenting about how much time I spend online, most likely because of the significant number of good "links" I come across (videos, news articles, new blogs, etc.). They may be absolutely correct that I spend too much time on the Web, but fact is I get so much news and other fun information from 54 (and counting) blogs and various news feeds almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I don't actually visit 54 websites every day. To read those 54 sites, I visit just one: &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google Reader is an online application similar to Gmail or Yahoo Mail that frequently goes out and checks all my favorite websites and adds new stuff (things I haven't seen yet) to my queue -- an "inbox" of sorts. Instead of logging in to read email, I log in to read new blog posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I browse through the list of things, they get marked as "read" and disappear (unless I go digging for them). It's really quite useful, and I'm always surprised when a friend says they visit their favorite blogs the old-fashioned way. It's fine for one or two, but when you get to the point where you have 20 or so friends' blogs, it's impossible to keep up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, check it out. Google Reader. It's not just for geeks, I promise.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/07/how-to-read-54-blogs-every-day.html' title='How To Read 54 Blogs Every Day'/><link rel='related' href='http://reader.google.com' title='How To Read 54 Blogs Every Day'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=2742258326260147962' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2742258326260147962'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2742258326260147962'/><author><name>Tim Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-1916598093361291234</id><published>2007-06-23T09:43:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-23T11:08:15.485-05:00</updated><title type='text'>It Came From Within, Chapter 18</title><content type='html'>How can I teach Mackenzie how to  process what life sends her way? How to guard her heart against the inevitable firestorms of life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;So what do we do? Other than do all we can to get our own hearts in shape, what can we do to infuse health into the hearts of our children? For starters we can teach them the importance of confession, forgiveness, and generosity. We can teach them to celebrate the successes of others. We can pray. We can model good habits. We can make sure they are in church. We can look for teachable moments. &lt;/span&gt;(pg 203-204)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;The questions you ask your children communicate to them what is important to you. The questions you repeatedly ask communicate what is &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;most&lt;/span&gt; important to you in life. &lt;/span&gt;(pg 205)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Our questions have the power to do two things. First, they can communicate the value we place on the condition of their hearts. But more importantly, our questions can actually help our children know what they sould be watching for. In time, our questions will become the gauge by which our children measure their hearts. &lt;/span&gt;(pg 206)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended questions for the weekly bedtime routine with each child. (From pg 207)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is everything okay in your heart?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you mad at anybody?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did anybody hurt your feelings today?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Did anybody break a promise to you today?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there anything you need to tell me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you worried about anything?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whose failure would you secretly celebrate?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;We should wake up every day of our lives with an eye on the gauges of our hearts. But better yet, imagine a generation of children who grow up attuned not only to what's happening around them but inside of them as well. Imagine your children growing up with an extraordinary sensitivity to the rhythms of their hearts. I don't have to tell you the difference that would make in their lives. You know the difference it would have made for you... As adults, we have been instructed to guard our hearts with all diligence. As parents, we have been given the responsibility to teach our kids to guard theirs. If the heart of your child is important to you, ask your child about what's going on in there. Teach your child to confess, forgive, give generously, and celebrate the successes of others. These are the habits that keep a heart free from painful clutter. There are the habits that will enable your child to develop a healthy adult relationship with you in the future. These are the habits that will change everything. &lt;/span&gt;(pg 210)</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/06/it-came-from-within-chapter-18.html' title='It Came From Within, Chapter 18'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=1916598093361291234' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/1916598093361291234'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/1916598093361291234'/><author><name>Jennie Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-6665917007644850940</id><published>2007-06-18T08:45:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-18T08:45:12.528-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dad Shaving His Beard</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/82388008/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/36/82388008_cc0650da06_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/82388008/"&gt;dad 008&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/timothymorgan/"&gt;Tim Morgan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just ran across this pic from my collection of scanned images.

(Our normal doctor was out for a week.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Have you ever been here before," the lady in the window asked. "Nope," I replied. She said I would have to fill out these forms and she would need to make a photocopy of my driver's license and my insurance card. OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I waited. And waited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my name was called, and I was taken back, weighed, and the young lady asked me a bunch of health questions. "Any history of chronic illness?" "Any bloating?" That sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then she handed me a cup and asked that I visit the bathroom and fill it up. Hmmm. Never done that before. But I obliged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came out, she was gone. Hmmm. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Where do I put this warm cup of pee?&lt;/span&gt; I thought. So I went back to the exam room I came from and sat it on the counter in there. Seconds later, another lady popped through the door, chuckled politely as if she was irritated I had put it in the wrong place or that she had to chase me down or something, I don't know. She grabbed the pee cup, and left. Weird. I didn't know I was supposed to give the pee to someone in particular, because no one told me. There wasn't a sign that said &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;All pee cups go to Ann&lt;/span&gt; (or whatever her name was). And for that matter, there wasn't any signs in the bathroom regarding &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; to pee in a cup. I mean, I thought I would get some guidance. But then again, I'm sure you're supposed to be taught these things as a child, and my parents just forgot to tell me how to pee in a cup or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I waited. And waited. In fact, I waited so long, I had to pee again (my wife is chuckling now because she has always said I have a tiny bladder). As I opened the door to go find the restroom again, the first lady spotted me and had an &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Oh crap, I forgot about him&lt;/span&gt; look on her face. Yup. They forgot about me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a minute later, the doctor was in the room ready to talk. Coincidence? No, I think they really forgot I was even in the building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He asked me more questions, well actually, he asked me mostly the same questions the other lady asked me. All the time I'm answering these questions, I'm thinking &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;why don't you just look at that piece of paper the assistant lady filled out with my answers?&lt;/span&gt; But no problem. I'm sure he's really just confirming what he sees so he'll have something to say. Silence is awkward for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He felt my side. He felt my belly. Then he said he would have to do a hernia check. You know, the one you had to do to play high school sports (one of the reasons I didn't play sports in high school was I heard some guy had to touch my private). If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry; I didn't either. I won't go into the details, but it was awkward for sure. That's all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told me he wasn't sure what was wrong with me, except that he knew it wasn't a hernia, and he gave me a few things to try. "If the pain isn't gone in 7-10 days, then come back," he instructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the first lady reappeared, rattled off all the things he had said I should do, and said to follow her. So I did. She walked down the hall and straight into the reception area, except she went to the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; side. She started making copies on a photocopier. I almost followed her in, wondering whether she meant I was supposed to follow her until she stopped, or just until I felt I had gone far enough, or what. Right then, another lady behind a counter, in her irritated voice, said "Overrrr herrrre."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man I felt stupid. Again, no signs, no instruction. Well, actually the instruction was to follow her, but she forgot to say &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;stop&lt;/span&gt;. She probably didn't play &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;green light, red light&lt;/span&gt; when she was in school. Or she forgot how to play maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so my point in this excruciatingly detailed account, is to talk about the church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What? The &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;church&lt;/span&gt;? Yup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been awhile since I was new to a church. It's been a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; while since I was new to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; church. And I can't remember last week, let alone several years ago. But I have to imagine that church is like a clinic for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They walk in, get no instruction on what they're expected to do. Sure, they might get a bulletin if they walk toward the worship service (but only if the worship service is about to start). They do get a smile and a handshake, though. Great. Problem is, those greeter people don't want to make someone feel stupid, so they don't say "Is this your first time to church?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they head for the welcome center (clearly marked of course), they might see 20 or so upcoming ministry events and sign-up sheets. Places to put checks and buy books. A computer to sign into the members-only website and look up fellow churchgoers. But is there anything that really tells them what to do? Where to go?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't mean a list of Sunday School classes. I mean something that really says, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;hey this is what church is all about, you're welcome here, and for your first time, you may wish to just attend the worship service; it starts at 10:30. If you're early, feel free to check out our cafe and grab a bagel and coffee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't know. I'm not an expert on these things. I just imagine it must be scary to someone who's never been to church before. I know our church building is quite large, and we have several other buildings, and it would be overwhelming to see everything all at once and not know where to go. Signs are good. But not enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the clinic thing, remember I said when I first got there, I was bombarded with forms and they wanted copies of my stuff? Is church any different? As soon as we spot someone new, we have them fill out all sorts of forms so we can get their information. It's scary to some. I wouldn't do it if I were brand new to a church. First, I'd want to know what they're going to use my information for. Are they going to send me stuff in the mail? Is someone going to stop by my house in the middle of the week and ask probing questions? Are they going to call me at dinnertime? Are they going to spam my email all the time? What if I want to get the heck &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;off&lt;/span&gt; their mailing list(s); would I be able to?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennie I visited Saddleback Church in California awhile back. It was quite neat and very large. The campus was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;huge&lt;/span&gt; and there weren't a lot of signs as I recall. Anyway, I filled out a form with my name and my email address. To this day, years later, I still get email from their pastor regarding upcoming sermon series. We didn't even attend normal services; we visited the college service on Wednesday night. I never saw the pastor when I was there. The emails have no indication of how to be removed from their mailing list. So, I replied directly to the pastor and asked to be removed from their list. No reply. Next month, another email about an upcoming sermon series. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Thank you, but I'm not interested in your sermon series, because I don't live in California and I'll not likely be visiting your church any time soon. Would you remove me from your list, please?&lt;/span&gt; No reply. It went on like this for a year. I would reply each time, directly to the pastor who sent the email, get no reply, then get another mass mailing a month later. Finally, I just set up a filter in my email to move it directly to the trash. Not cool, Saddleback. Shame on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I give an organization my personal information, my prized and sacred personal contact details, I want to know what they're going to use them for. I want to know I can easily get my stuff out of their database if I request it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinic: I was asked the same questions more than once.&lt;br /&gt;Church: People have to give their name and address when they drop off their children at Preschool, then they have to provide the same information and answer the same questions on the attendance tear strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinic: People assumed I knew where to go, what to do.&lt;br /&gt;Church: Check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinic: You get weird looks when you do something wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Church: Check. Don't believe me? Just try taking a baby into the worship service. You'll get looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinic: The doctor was unsure what was wrong with me, but gave me some things to try.&lt;br /&gt;Church: People are told to use their "gifts" in service to the church and it's programming. Find a place to serve, and jump in. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I'm not sure what your gifts are, but keep coming, and I'm sure you'll figure it out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rant could go forever, so I'll stop here. Ponder this much. I'll save the rest for another post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Church is like a clinic because everybody assumes you know what you're doing. You've been there ten times already, no doubt, and I don't want to make myself feel stupid by asking if it's your first time (because that would show whether or not I actually &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;see&lt;/span&gt; people).</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/05/church-is-like-clinic.html' title='Church Is Like a Clinic'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=6306692438287782963' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/6306692438287782963'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/6306692438287782963'/><author><name>Tim Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-633131543559457783</id><published>2007-05-09T23:29:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-09T23:35:54.971-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Locke is Dead!</title><content type='html'>My favorite character on Lost, the most spiritual of the whole bunch, is dead!

I was saddened a little that they chose Pepsi, but that makes sense being that it was a small and not wildly-successful place, and I happen to know that Pepsi products are cheaper (in both senses of the word).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I ordered a Calzone. At the time I was ordered, I wondered to myself, if it should be pronounced Cal-Zone (with a long 'o') or Cal-Zone-Y (with a long 'o' and an 'ie' on the end). I've heard it both ways, and you always want to look less like a dumb American in front of people who are less white and speak less English than you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it came out, it resembled a deflated football. Funny, because I thought for sure Calzone was big and round with a hole in the middle, and cut into eight or so slices. And the dipping sauce goes in the hole, of course. Hmmm... turns out that's an Americanized thing too, I guess. After all, Mazzio's probably didn't invent the Calzone anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, cut into this thing with my knife and fork, and oh boy. It was like heaven. Cheese. And more cheese. And ham. Ham? Where's my pepperoni? Oh well... it was wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My point? Who knows. Except that I would like to start branching out a bit when it comes to eating out. Mazzio's and Subway and Taco Bueno don't have a patent on good food.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/05/some-randomness.html' title='Cal-zone-ie'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=2879102050447583973' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2879102050447583973'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2879102050447583973'/><author><name>Tim Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-7034650685260160287</id><published>2007-05-02T15:40:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-05-02T15:41:42.440-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Psalm 92:4 (NASB)</title><content type='html'>&lt;span id="en-NASB-15416" class="sup"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;For You, O LORD, have made me glad by what You have done, I will sing for joy at the works of Your hands.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/05/psalm-924-nasb.html' title='Psalm 92:4 (NASB)'/><link rel='related' href='http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2092:4;&amp;version=49;' title='Psalm 92:4 (NASB)'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=7034650685260160287' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/7034650685260160287'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/7034650685260160287'/><author><name>Jennie Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-2796031403968234195</id><published>2007-04-30T00:21:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-30T00:24:52.449-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Psalm 1:1-3</title><content type='html'>Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked&lt;br /&gt;or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his delight is in the law of the Lord,&lt;br /&gt;and on his law he meditates day and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is like a tree planted by streams of water,&lt;br /&gt;which yields its fruit in season&lt;br /&gt;and whose leaf does not wither.&lt;br /&gt;Whatever he does prospers.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/04/psalm-11-3.html' title='Psalm 1:1-3'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=2796031403968234195' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2796031403968234195'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/2796031403968234195'/><author><name>Jennie Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-593606018582230679</id><published>2007-04-28T01:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-27T23:23:58.160-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Isaiah 53:5 (NIV)</title><content type='html'>He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities;

I'm still reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Present-Future-Tough-Questions-Church/dp/0787965685"&gt;The Present Future&lt;/a&gt; by Reggie McNeal. It is very challenging! Today I read chapter four. Here's what I learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The kingdom is people... Helping people develop emotionally, physically, and relationally is all spiritual... Spiritual formation includes personal spiritual disciplines, but it also includes the stewardship of our relationships, our work, and our life mission." (pg. 73)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if we handled Christians like fitness club members. Let me explain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Instead of dumping a packet of church club member stuff on them, why not interview them about what they would like to see happen in their lives in terms of their spiriutal development and personal growth?... Once a life coach or spiritual development coach completed this interview, they could then fashion a customized personal growth stragegy for the person or family... This could be done for each family member." (pg. 76)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How cool would that be. The book also encouraged the life/spiritual development coach    to get together with the family every month and check on their progress. "Instead of signaling to them that they are there to find their way into church stuff and make the church successful, the focus is completely turned around. The church treats them as a market of one, convincing them that the church is there to help them develop an abundant life promised to them by Jesus." (pg. 77)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Evangelism that will introduce Jesus to this culture will flow from people who are deeply in love with Jesus." (pg. 82)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May our topic be: life. And may we create an environment that helps people develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jesus is the answer&lt;br /&gt;for the world today.&lt;br /&gt;Above Him there's no other.&lt;br /&gt;Jesus is the way.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/04/new-reality-number-four.html' title='New Reality Number Four'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=8718258748066599536' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/8718258748066599536'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/8718258748066599536'/><author><name>Jennie Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-7912011010521697565</id><published>2007-04-16T23:28:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-16T23:30:06.130-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Awesome Wedding + Silly String = Good Times</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/459352832/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/220/459352832_cfcd7f95cb_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="margin-top: 0px;font-size:0;" &gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/459352832/"&gt;00143&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/timothymorgan/"&gt;Tim Morgan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Score another mark for the church 20-something hook-up ministry, er...

It was a lot of fun. And the reception, while Jennie and I wisely chose not to embarrass ourselves by dancing, was loads of fun. The element to remember was the moment the entire wedding party aimed their 20 or so cans of silly string at the bride and groom slow dancing, and over the next 30-45 seconds, covered them in gooey, slimy stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More pics &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/timothymorgan/sets/72157600080717083/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/2007/04/awesome-wedding-silly-string-good-times.html' title='Awesome Wedding + Silly String = Good Times'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10784898&amp;postID=7912011010521697565' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://family.timmorgan.org/atom.xml' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/7912011010521697565'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10784898/posts/default/7912011010521697565'/><author><name>Tim Morgan</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10784898.post-1701801599615435319</id><published>2007-04-16T23:11:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-16T23:15:24.472-05:00</updated><title type='text'>VA Peeps</title><content type='html'>Jennie and I had some house guests this weekend.
