Email Forwarding
----------------

To set up the app to accept mail on a domain, set up your favorite
mail server and create a catch-all address. In the home directory of
the user to which this address is associated, copy the dot-forward file
(in this directory) and rename as ".forward" (without the quotes).
Edit the file and adjust the path to the app as appropriate.
