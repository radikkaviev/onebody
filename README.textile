OneBody is free, open-source, volunteer-built software that connects churchgoers on the web.

Built by volunteers at a mid-sized, independent church in the heart of the United States, OneBody allows any church to add social network features to their website by using data stored in their existing church management software.

The revolutionary thing about OneBody is that it is designed to work with any church management software or database.
