Email Forwarding
----------------

To set up the app to accept mail on a domain, set up your favorite
mail server and create a catch-all address for your domain.

Add the following line to your /etc/crontab file:

*/2 * * * * root /path/to/app/script/inbox host username password

This will run the inbox script every two minutes, logging into "host" with
"username" and "password", and grabbing new email.
