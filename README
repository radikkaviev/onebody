OneBody - online church membership directory and social networking site
http://beonebody.org

History
-------

OneBody is a project that grew out of a need we had at Cedar Ridge
Christian Church for an online directory. The project evolved over
time to become what it is today. Now, as an open source project,
we hope to see OneBody grow into something even greater as other
people/churches contribute back to the project based on their own
needs and desires.
