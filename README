Installation
============

The following instructions are for Linux/Unix only. Installation on Windows
should be possible, but as of the writing of this, 

Prerequisites: Ruby on Rails, MySQL, RMagick

1. svn co http://svn.71m.org/svn/cedarridgefamily/trunk /where/you/want/cedarridgefamily
2. gem install 'pdf-writer'
3. Create a database in MySQL called "crccweb"
4. If your MySQL root user has a password, modify config/database.yml appropriately
5. cd /where/you/installed/cedarridgefamily
6. mysql -u root -p crccweb < db/crccweb.sql
7. rake db:migrate

For development, you may run script/server and browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000

For production environments, you may wish to set up some load balancing
and such. Google is your friend.

Email Forwarding
----------------

To set up the app to accept mail on a domain, set up your favorite
mail server and create a catch-all address for your domain.

Add the following line to your /etc/crontab file:

*/2 * * * * root /path/to/app/script/inbox host username password

This will run the inbox script every two mintues, logging into "host" with
"username" and "password", and grabbing new email.
