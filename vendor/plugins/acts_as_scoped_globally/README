ActsAsScopedGlobally
====================

This plugin allows one to set the scope of queries on an ActiveRecord model
somewhere other than in the queries themselves.

This can be best explained with an example. For instance, in the case of
OneBody, the system was not designed initially with multiple hosted sites
in mind. Because of that, the Person, Family, Group, and all other models
were not queried from the currently selected site.

Rather than going through line after line of code, ActsAsScopedGlobally was
developed to modify SQL queries to include reference to a currently selected
site.

class Site < ActiveRecord::Base
  cattr_accessor :current # a place to store our currently selected site
  has_many :people
end

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :site
  acts_as_scoped_globally 'site_id', 'Site.current.id'
end

Person.find_by_email('john@example.com')
# raises error because Site.current is not set

# OneBody sets this in the application controller based on hostname
Site.current = Site.find_by_host(request.host)
# <Site id=12>

Person.find_by_email('john@example.com')
# SELECT * FROM people where site_id = 12 and email = 'john@example.com';

Person.create(:email => 'tim@example.com')
# INSERT INTO people (email, site_id) values ('tim@example.com', 12)
