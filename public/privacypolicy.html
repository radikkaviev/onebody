<h1>Website privacy policy</h1>


<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our members and regular attenders; 
this policy sets out how we will treat your personal information.</p>


<h4>(1)	What information do we collect?</h4>

<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>

<p>(a) information about your visits to and use of this website;</p>

<p>(b) information that you provide to us for the purpose of registering 
with us and/or subscribing to our website services and/or email notifications; and</p>

<p>(d) OTHER INFORMATION.<sup>1</sup></p>


<h4>(2)	Information about website visits</h4>

<p>We may collect information about you computer and your visits to this website 
such as your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, 
length of visit and number of page views. We may use this information in the 
administration of this website, to improve the website's usability, and for 
marketing purposes.</p>

<p>We use cookies on this website. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server 
to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The text file is then sent back to 
the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the 
web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>

<p>We may send a cookie which may be stored on by your browser on your computer's 
hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration 
of this website, to improve the website's usability and for marketing purposes.  
We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our 
website, and to personalise our website for you.</p>

<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies.  (For example, in Internet 
Explorer you can refuse all cookie by clicking "Tools", "Internet Options", "Privacy", 
and selecting "Block all cookies" using the sliding selector.)  This will, however, 
have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one.<sup>2</sup></p>


<h4>(3)	Using your personal data</h4>

<p>Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in 
this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>

<p>In addition to the uses identified elsewhere in this privacy policy, we may use 
your personal information to:</p>

<p>(a) improve your browsing experience by personalizing the website;</p>

<p>(b) OTHER USES.<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>We will not without your express consent provide your personal information to any third 
parties for the purpose of direct marketing.</p>


<h4>(4) Other disclosures</h4>

<p>In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere 
in this privacy policy, we may disclose information about you:</p>

<p>(a)	to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</p>

<p>(b)	in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;</p>

<p>(c)	in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing information 
to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); and</p>

<p>Except as provided in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.</p>




<h4>(6)	Security of your personal data</h4>

<p>We will take reasonable precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your 
personal information. Of course, data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure, 
and we cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the internet.</p>

<p>You are responsible for keeping your password confidential. We will not ask you for your password.</p>


<h4>(7)	Policy amendments<sup>8</sup></h4>

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version 
on our website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy 
with any changes.</p>


<h4>(8) Contact</h4>
