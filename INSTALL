Linux/Unix Prerequisites
------------------------

Consult your operating system help for guidance on installing the
packages below. Most likely, your distribution provides a package
management program that will easily install all of these components.

* Ruby
* MySQL
* Ruby MySQL library
* ImageMagick
* RMagick (aka Ruby ImageMagick library)
* Rubygems
* Apache

The names on your system may be different from the above.


Windows Prerequisites
---------------------

1. Install Ruby 1.8.5 (not 1.8.6) from
   https://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167&release_id=10461
2. Download RMagick from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=12&release_id=8170
   (choose the highlighted ZIP package)
   a. Extract and run the ImageMagick installer.
   b. From a command prompt, cd to the extracted folder and run:
      gem install rmagick-x.x.x-win32.gem
      (replace X with version numbers)
3. Download and install MySQL from
   http://mysql.org/downloads/mysql/5.0.html#win32
   (choose Windows Essentials)
4. Download and install Apache from
   http://mirror.nyi.net/apache/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.2.4-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi
   

Install
-------

Run the following commands from a terminal/command prompt. For installation on Windows,
replace Unix paths (forward slashes) below with Windows paths.

1. gem install onebody

2. onebody install INSTALL_DIR db_user=USER db_password=PASSWORD db_host=localhost
   
   INSTALL_DIR    = the path where you want it, e.g. /var/rails/onebody or c:\www\onebody

   USER, PASSWORD = a user that can create databases and such
                    probably "root" and "" (blank) on a stock install

OneBody should now be installed and just about ready to use. You have a few more things
to do, but at this point you can fire up the Rails server and a web browser and poke
around.

To see OneBody in action right away, run:

  cd INSTALL_DIR
  rake db:fixtures:load
  onebody start .

Then, visit the address on the screen with your web browser. You can sign in with the
user "morgans@somedomain.com" and password "secret".

Startup
-------

On Linux/Unix you'll need to set up an init.d script to start your Rails server
when the OS boots.

On Windows, run the following commands from a command prompt:
1. gem install mongrel_service
2. mongrel_rails service::install -N onebody -c INSTALL_DIR -p 4000 -e production
3. net start onebody
4. sc config onebody start= auto dependency= MySql
Note: The service will run on port 4000; change your Apache config to match

Apache
------

View installer/apache13.conf.example or installer/apache20.conf.example (depending on
the version of Apache you're running) for instructions to connect your public facing
web server with the Rails server.

Email Forwarding
----------------

To set up the app to accept mail on a domain, set up your favorite
mail server and...

1. Create a catch-all address/mailbox for your domain (this will be different for
   every mail server).

2. Replace HOST, USERNAME, and PASSWORD appropriately in the command below.
   Should be user capable of logging into the mailbox, reading, and deleting mail.

   Linux/Unix
   ----------
   Add the following line to your /etc/crontab file:
   */2 * * * * root INSTALL_DIR/script/inbox HOST USERNAME PASSWORD
   
   Windows
   -------
   Set up a scheduled task to run the following command once every few minutes:
   INSTALL_DIR\script\inbox host username password
