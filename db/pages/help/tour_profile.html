<h2>Profile Tab</h2>

<p>
  This is your profile page &mdash; the page all about you.
  Here you'll see your own most recent activity on the site,
  things you've shared, and notes that others have sent to
  you.
</p>

<p>
  On the left, you'll find links to your family, groups, and
  other people you're keeping track of.
</p>

<h3>About You</h3>

<p>
  Someone looking for you on the site will see this page
  mostly the same way you do. You can ensure your contact
  information and other details about you are up-to-date
  by clicking <img src="/images/pencil.png" class="icon"/>
  "Edit Profile." There you can upload a picture of yourself,
  change your mobile phone number, list your favorite books,
  and much more. <em>Share as little or as much as you want.</em>
</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>
  You can quickly and easily hide parts of your information
  by clicking <img src="/images/lock.png" class="icon"/>
  "Privacy Settings."
